A month's slipped by  
and still in my mind's eye  
the comet shines clear  
over the horizon  
unearthly beauty  
slender threads of light  
pale roots streaking upward  
from the comet's head
an upside down medusa  
floating below the Bear  
rare visitor, she'll be back again  
though not next year  
nor even next millenium  
and we will be long gone  
at least from here  
perhaps we'll be way out  
where comets cruise  
far beyond Neptune  
riding the long elipse  
heading for home
