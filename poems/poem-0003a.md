The old house on five acres  
just a couple miles outside the town  
it's a year now since we left, and look  
the blackberries are back in force  
as if they meant to overrun  
the whole damn place!  
some trees have died  
but most have made it through  
the pond is dry  
but given that it's August  
no surprise there  
what's surprising are the quinces  
planted ten years back  
along the drive  
a week of watering and hey  
they're not just looking fresh  
they're blossoming

All day it's quiet  
but as dusk comes on  
the high piping of tree frogs  
crickets and of other  
small musicians hiding in the grass  
fills the darkening air until  
it's hard to think.

Anyway too late to think of moving back  
our house in town is everything we wanted  
but this place with the creek, the pond,  
the oaks and ponderosas  
the thirty years of plantings and of memories  
it's no small thing to let it go  
it's no small thing.
