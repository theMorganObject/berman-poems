The old house on five acres  
a few miles from town  
it's been a year since we packed up and left  
and look - the blackberries I'd hacked  
and dug up by the roots  
are back in force  
as if they mean to overrun  
the whole damn place  
some trees have died  
but most have made it through  
the pond is dry  
but given that it's August  
that's no surprise  
what is surprising are the quinces  
I planted ten years back along the drive  
a week of watering and already  
they're not just looking fresh  
they're blossoming!

It's been quiet all day long  
but now as dusk falls  
the piping of the tree frogs and the shrill  
cacophony of crickets blending with  
the voices of a thousand other  
small musicians fill the dark  
until it's hard to think

Too late now to move back  
our house in town  
with its third acre yard  
is all that we can manage  
but this place with the running creek  
the pond, the ponderosas  
the old oaks  
the thirty years of plantings  
and of memories  
no little thing to let it go  
no little thing
