Bro did you hear? Julian Bream just died!  
from Sao Paolo my brother phoned me  
knowing I'd want to know  
Bream, the genial English prodigy  
who opened up the world of Dowland's dances  
pavans, galliards, almains, corrantos jigges,  
music for seven and eight-course lute  
embodying the wit, the grace the rich vitality  
of that now distant age we call Elizabethan  
the age Shakespeare bestrode  
like some colossus

Bream's mastery was stunning  
yet his manner made you feel included  
not just receptive audience but deeply sharing  
in the joy of making music  
his own wit often matched  
that of composer  
"I'll now play Tarleton's Riserrectione  
followed by The Lady Clifton's Spirit"

If there's a heaven Julian is there  
I hear him playing Dowland's Melancholy  
Galliard and Come Again Sweet Love  
Without his music how could it be heaven!
