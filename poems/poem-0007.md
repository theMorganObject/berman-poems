Raise a ruckus  
raise the roof  
raise a daughter  
on the hoof

raise tomatoes  
raise a barn  
keep the daughter  
safe from harm

dough still rising  
jesus risen  
keep the daughter  
far from prison

raise the anchor  
raise the sails  
head for home when  
all else fails

get a raise or  
get a rise  
look your daughter  
in the eyes

pluck a rose  
raise the dead  
poem's over  
time for bed
