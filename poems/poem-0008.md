Stung again!  
hate those damn yellowjackets  
hard to see their nests  
just little holes in the ground  
It's not the sting  
but the itching that comes later  
keeping me up at night  
wanting to scratch and knowing better  
so much of life's like that  
we learn  
or else we don't  
to do what children can't  
to bear the itching  
the rawness that only worsens  
when we claw at it  
can't blame the bees  
they're only defending what's theirs  
if I could make them understand  
I mean no harm  
but now harm's done  
and I've no wish to risk  
another sting  
so sorry bees  
your nest's a goner  
maybe you'll find another  
spot to dig your hole  
far from our house  
as far as I'm concerned  
couldn't be far enough!
