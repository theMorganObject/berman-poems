My friend David says  
he doesn't like surprises  
maybe because he's from Chicago  
and maybe it's been true for him  
that what has shown up unexpectedly  
has rarely be good news  
but I've a different take  
I say the the soul loves a surprise  
and so this evening when a small  
brown bag appeared on our front porch  
I thought who, what and why and will it  
be - I hope- for me  
and sure enough inside the bag  
a book of poems  
hardbound, lovely  
Ledger by Jane Hirschfield  
and in the cover a short note  
my neighbor Michael saying that  
he left it with a smile  
so now as I anticipate the many pleasures  
and surprises that I know this book will hold  
my soul is dancing
