At night in bed  
when my dear wife reaches  
over with her wonderfully  
articulate feet  
and caresses mine  
it's almost as if  
a hand with fingers  
were touching me  
My feet, on the other hand  
wholly inarticulate  
toes don't spread  
arch doesn't curl  
and half the time I'm hardly  
knowing where they are  
still I feel only gratitude  
for all the years and miles  
both booted and barefoot  
they've served as the best  
the safest most reliable  
mode of transportation  
way of getting around

The places they've taken me  
soft meadows, sandy beaches  
river bottoms, mountain trails  
city streets and subways  
parks, museums, concert halls  
football fields and ski slopes  
rarely complaining  
asking just the minimum

Lately Ive started  
bathing them in epsom salts  
scrubbing the bottoms  
with a scrub brush in the shower  
working in lotion  
to keep the skin from drying  
It's time, I figure,  
to give something back  
just shy of my eightieth  
year on the planet  
I'm hoping they'll still agree  
to take me on a trip or two  
there's countries and counties  
even a continent  
ice fields and islands  
I have yet to see  
Roethke put it out there  
old men should be explorers  
with two feet to take me  
what more could I ask for  
I'm ready  
let's start walking now
