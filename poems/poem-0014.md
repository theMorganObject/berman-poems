down in the mind's deep waters  
time passes  
nothing bites  
not a nibble  
and I wonder  
am I using the wrong bait  
or are they simply waiting  
to see how long before  
I call it quits, reel in  
and head for home

But there is always one  
given time and patience  
that's willing, even eager  
to be landed in my net  
the only sad thing is  
brought up into the daylight  
how quickly the colors fade  
the iridescence dulls

Yet something of that deeper  
world below the surface  
makes it through to nourish  
our terrestrial hearts  
to remind us  
of our aquatic past  
the wisdom of that distant age  
when we moved weightlessly  
through a sensuous liquid space  
open in all directions

It doesn't happen often  
but now and then a poem  
instead of surfacing  
pulls you in and takes you there
