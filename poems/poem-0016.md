after Wang Wei

One time I built a house at Big Lagoon  
by Patrick's Point just above Agate Beach  
from my bedroom I could hear sea lions bark  
grey whales rolled and spouted just offshore  
evenings I'd watch the sun drop in the sea  
an orange disk that turned the whole horizon  
a hundred shades of green and blue and yellow  
at night I'd lie and listen to the breakers

Once walking with my partner on the beach  
a whale swam in so close that we could look  
down on it's blow hole, even smell its breath  
not foul but something like fresh abalone  
she waded in, thinking to touch its tail  
I held her back, afraid she might be injured  
perhaps it was the wrong move on my part  
to touch a living whale - that would be something  
to remember when you're living in the hills

Now I've lived inland more than twenty years  
coming to the coast only from time to time  
although I've left the sea, she's not left me  
closing my eyes I still can hear waves pounding  
the shore, and feel the lifting of the swells  
as when I ventured out in my kayak  
the little craft I named the Surf Scoter  
after the small bird that dives and surfaces  
so smoothly it's always a joy to watch

The house I built is long since sold, but it too  
lives on in memory, in many memories  
the building of it was perhaps the best part  
a year out of my life when every day  
required a certain focus and an effort  
and the comraderie of hard work shared

Now that my life is more in past than future  
these things take on fresh meaning, and I bless  
my parents, grandparents, the countless ancestors  
whose struggles made the present possible  
this human life we share with all its griefs  
its joys and moments of illumination  
and thus the ocean for all its living presence  
and majesty is also metaphor
