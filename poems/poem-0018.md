Unlike minutes, hours, days  
the moments of our lives  
are a measure  
not of time but of significance  
like the moment you first learned  
to balance on a bicycle  
the moment you first met the man  
the woman you would marry

true, sometimes it's a lie  
as when you tell your wife  
I'll only be a moment dear  
meanwhile searching everywhere  
for your cellphone, your glasses, your keys

on the cosmic scale a moment  
can be a nanosecond  
think of the Big Bang  
while for an ordinary star  
a hundred million years  
is scarcely a moment's passing

but in this brief time  
the little time we have here  
the things we call momentous  
happen in minutes, hours, days  
and yet we rarely speak  
of the minute we met  
the hour when we first kissed  
the day that we first knew  
he or she was the one  
for these are the precious  
moments of our lives  
and by this word we honor  
the way they resonate  
the moments that give shape  
and meaning to our lives  
and perhaps in the end  
all that we really own  
are the moments
