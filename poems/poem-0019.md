How I Knew (for Carroll)

It was our first real outing  
a drive to Klamath Falls  
to see the winter waterfowl  
but no, there's too much snow  
so Shasta for a ski weekend  
staying at your brother's lodge  
near Shasta Lake

Still new and not yet intimate  
we were enjoying testing  
each other  
and ourselves as well  
after supper  
a glass of wine  
we found ourselves  
lightheartedly  
wrestling on the rug

It happened when I thought  
to pin you down  
and found myself  
quite unexpectedly  
flipped over your shoulder

what was that? I asked  
oh just a shoulder flip  
a trick girls learn  
by way of self protection

Little time to wonder  
how you'd managed it  
because as I was getting up  
I felt a pain  
it seemed a rib  
had cracked or maybe broken

And that was how I knew  
this would be no little fling  
nothing flippant about this woman  
I remember thinking

Back then it didn't strike me  
the biblical connection  
but now that for these many years  
you've been Eve  
to my Adam  
when I remember  
the broken rib  
(three months to heal)  
I think about that shoulder flip  
and can't help smiling
