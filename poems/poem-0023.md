Ollie is our Maine coon cat  
at sixteen pounds he was no kitten  
the day we brought him home  
from the Humane Society

I still laugh recalling how  
out of the blue my wife said  
sweetie just get in the car  
and don't ask any questions

She drove and we were shortly  
parked before the animal shelter  
we had two dogs already so  
I had some clue

I poked around  
fancied a smallish siamese  
but Carroll had I think  
already been there  
made her choice

In her usual calm and un-  
assuming way she motioned me  
to where this large and very orange  
cat was riding quite contented  
on the shoulder of a gal  
who volunteered there

My first thought was of our dogs  
how would they handle this intruder  
Carroll was quick to reassure me  
Ollie was experienced  
had lived with dogs

And sure enough  
without the slightest fuss  
or hesitation he informed our poodles  
(big ones, not the toys)  
so long as they behaved themselves  
their noses would be spared

Not long after that I caught  
our Lucca licking Ollie's neck  
and Ollie tolerating it even  
if only for a moment

Now seven or eight years have passed  
the dogs are showing signs of age  
and Ollie too  
it's hard to think  
of life without them

Ollie cat still loves to ride  
on my shouders and to knead  
Carroll's sweater swishing  
his luxurious white-tipped tail

I've heard that folks live longer  
when they share their homes with dogs and cats  
I know all three of ours  
have done a lot  
to humanize me

With just my wife and I  
here at the house our canine  
feline friends  
have helped to keep us sane  
through this long year  
of social distancing

But that is saying nothing of  
the thousand and one playful momentsthe laughter, the surprises  
all the loving gestures  
soulful looks  
with which these fellow travellers  
continue to enrich our lives

I  
I grew up with dogs  
always loved them easily  
but Ollie is the first feline  
to purr his way  
into my heart.  
The only real mistake I made  
was teaching him to talk  
now he loudly lets me in  
on his every mood and need  
but when he's lying curled  
up sleeping on the couch  
there's nothing in the world  
that breathes more deeply  
of domestic peace

It's written if the kingdom  
were in heaven birds would  
get there first  
Ollie's kingdom is the couch  
his heaven is rich with all the  
birds he catches in his dreams  
sleep well Ollie cat
