Working today at the old place  
cutting deadwood off apple trees  
I heard high overhead  
two geese  
flying in tandem  
trading goose talk  
heading south

My first thought was  
it's early  
winter's months away  
they must be fleeing the wildfiress  
burning to the north

Then I thought of how  
through three millenia  
Chinese poets found  
in the flight of the wild geese  
a much beloved trope  
firstly for evoking  
the kaleidoscope of feelings  
that follow from the changing  
of the seasons

Then for embodying  
that wild effortless freedom  
denied to us  
poor wingless creatures  
who have traded off  
our wildness  
for certain civilized comforts

To rise aloft  
and fly away  
to leave behind  
the heavy tasks  
familial responsibilities  
that seem to hold us hostage  
this dream of flight  
humanity has shared  
perhaps from our beginnings

Beyond that dream  
the Chinese poets sensed  
the power of the unspoken vow  
that wedded goose and gander  
in their lifelong bond  
and I too as I watched this pair  
fly out if sight  
thought their bond  
a trope of sincerity  
something to wonder at  
admire  
emulate
