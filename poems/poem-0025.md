The little town  
perched above a wooded valley  
famed for its sixteenth century  
hosting of the great  
luminaries of Kabbalah  
Luria, Cordovero, Alkabetz  
men who raised the spiritual  
skyline of the faith  
their gravesites on the hillside  
visited by Jewish pilgrims  
like myself

My yeshivah roommate  
the one night I stayed  
a man of few words  
had come from Germany  
in the morning he suggested  
a walk across the valley  
to see the holy shrine at Meron

The shrine of Bar Yochai  
2nd century rabbi  
revered for writing Zohar  
the holy Book of Splendor  
written in fact  
in Spain and a millenium  
after Bar Yochai's death

Pausing mid-walk  
we sat and my companion  
shared with me a story

On the day of his wedding  
his fiancee was killed  
it was Munich or Berlin  
she was crossing the street  
struck down by a car  
pregnant  
nearly full term  
the doctors saved the child  
their son, now a grown man  
living in the US  
since then  
my friend told me  
he had made the choice  
to lead a single life

On the bus back to Tsfat  
he put the question to me  
so do you believe  
there's survival after death?  
I knew what he was asking  
perhaps even why  
and without hesitating  
I answered Yes I do  
the words came easily  
since it was what I thought  
this sweet man needed to hear

Since then  
more than once  
spirits have sought me out  
brought messages to pass on  
to others still among the living  
yet I've never known  
how to answer for myself  
the question I was asked  
all those years ago  
on the bus  
between Meron and Tsfat
