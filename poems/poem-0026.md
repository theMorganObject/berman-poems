January '39  
running from the fascists  
he made it into France  
just beyond the border  
to the seaside town of Collioure

There his mother died  
just days after they'd arrived  
and he followed her  
a month later

I knew nothing of this  
the death of the man  
the Spanish people honor  
as their greatest twentieth century poet

I'd come with a friend  
it was raining on the coast  
and idling in a bookstore  
I came across a little book  
in Spanish and in French

I asked where he was buried  
someone pointed up the street  
just walked a few blocks  
the graveyard was tiny  
his grave near the entrance  
the headstone had a quote  
from a poem called retrato

and when it arrives  
the day of my last journey  
and the ship is debarking  
never to return  
you'll find me on board  
with scarcely any baggage  
nearly naked  
like the children of the sea

This was lovely but  
what I discovered next  
touched and amazed me  
and still brings me delight

At the headstone a mailbox  
brimming over with letters  
written only recently  
addressed to the poet  
who was still quite alive  
in the minds of his readers  
though on another plane  
of existence

I tried to imagine  
my fellow Americans  
writing letters  
to Walt Whitman who also  
suffered civil war  
not likely I thought  
maybe you have to live  
through decades of fascist rule  
to apprreciate the gift
