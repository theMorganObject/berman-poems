    			White Deerskin Dance
    					Hupa September 1973

Closing my eyes
I still can see
that line of men
each holding his long pole
with deerskin draped
and antlered head
held high
  
Now swaying slowly
side to side
the poles
in steady rythm
move as if spellbound  
 the deer themselves
were dancing

Were they in trance
or was it I
entranced by that
slow steady line
the pale deer dancing overhead
their eyes dark
in the twilight?
Today it seems
a dream I had
long ago when
the world was young
and coming into view
for the first time
The Hupa say
without the dance
the earth will tilt
unbalance
and the ocean
overrun the land

Is that what's happening
now that we  
 have failed to take
our places
in the line
forgotten how
to circle round?

The whole tribe comes together
every fall to host
the dance and dancing
bring the world
back where it belongs
I worry there's
too few of them
too many of us others
who have lost
the knowledge
lost the way of dancing
But while the vision
of the sacred
deerskin dance lives on
this world
the world we love
is still not lost
