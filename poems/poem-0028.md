This year - the pandemic  
no Rosh HaShanah gathering  
making the memory of a year ago  
all the more precious

Back then I felt such quiet joy  
preparing to chant Torah  
to lead the Hebrew prayers  
one more time

To speak of Sarah, Avraham  
Hagar and Ishmael  
and the angel sent  
announcing God's remembrance

Which is also our remembrance  
when we think what's most needful  
for our souls, for life  
for fellow creatures everywhere

It was during the noon hour  
I'd been left alone  
in the little room that served  
as sinagogue

There was a knock on the door  
a man in green hospital garb  
stood asking could he  
join with me in prayer

His presence filled  
the little room with light  
a warmth it had lacked  
before he entered

It was as if an angel  
had appeared to bless us  
and our little temple  
with his light, his radiance

This year in Crescent City  
the Torah will remain  
locked inside its ark  
and the faithful

Will observe the holiday  
on Zoom and I too will sit  
and follow on a screen  
at a safe distance

But I will be remembering  
the angel who stopped by  
to bless us last year  
in Crescent City
