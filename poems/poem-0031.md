After the smoke  
 clouds and blue skies  
 quite like an old  
 Dutch master's canvas

How much they taught us  
 of clarity  
 and light - I'm thinking  
 of Vermeer

There's a print  
 from the Gardner  
 Vermeer's The Concert  
 one of my treasures  
A woman sits  
 at the harpsichord  
 another sings  
 from a small book  
The third - a man  
 his back to us  
 holding a lute  
 with a wide strap

Only the singer  
 faces us  
 we the imagined  
 audience  
It's one of only  
 forty-two  
 paintings the master  
 left behind

And stolen! missing  
 thirty years  
 this print the closest  
 we can come

Bought at the Gardner  
 when Vermeer's  
 canvas still hung  
 on the wall

No sky no clouds  
 are in that room  
 but the light shining  
 through the window

Transforms the space  
 creates an aura  
 that lights up  
 the women's faces

The tenderness  
 of the painter's vision  
 teaches my eyes  
 to see today

These clouds not just  
 in greater detail  
 but with the attention  
 and the love  
Of light and all  
 the sensuous world  
 thanks to the artist's  
 eye that saves

The world by painting  
 what we common  
 mortals would never  
 catch or miss

The Concert ( c. 1664) is a painting by Dutchman Johannes Vermeer  
 depicting a man and two women performing music.  
 It belonged to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston,  
 but was stolen in 1990 and remains missing.  
 Experts believe it may be the most valuable stolen object in the world;  
 as of 2015, it was valued at US$250 million.
