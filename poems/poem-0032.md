those who survive  
 the coming storms  
The fires  
 the floodwaters  
 the hurricanes  
The tens of millions  
 desperate  
 displaced  
By rising seas  
 by failing crops  
 by wars

And wonder  
 how we let ourselves  
 be duped  
By greedy  
 politicians  
 corporate interests  
The failures  
 of the nation states  
 to act  
They'll know  
 the climate science  
 was in place  
Decades before  
 the ice had  
 disappeared  
Not the first  
 civilization  
 to go under  
But the first  
 world wide  
 catastrophy  
Since human players  
 entered on  
 the scene

Our successes  
 bringing on  
 The sixth extinction  
Losing  
 with every year  
 a million species  
And now it looks  
 like we  
 may join that number  
Or as the rabbi  
 in the Jewish joke  
 advises  
We could grow gills  
 learn to live  
 under water

So little time  
 is left us now  
 to act  
Some are looking  
 for technology  
 to save us  
But most of us  
 continue  
 with our lives  
As though the world  
 we know  
 would last forever

I'm an old man  
 won't witness  
 the full fury  
My grandchildren  
 will have much  
 to endure  
I think of them  
 my heart if filled  
 with sorrrow  
And shame  
 I did so little  
 kept so quiet  
But they'll be wiser  
 knowing what's  
 at stake  
able perhaps  
 1o make  
 the changes needed  
 t  
To avert  
 the worst of  
 what's to come

I pray for them  
 and for the world  
 I love

The naked planet  
 all its teeming  
 life

Its mountains, forests  
 rivers, oceans  
 deserts

Its towns and cities  
 farms and  
 countryside  
May those in power  
 find the strength  
 the wisdom  
To save what still  
 is possible  
 to save
