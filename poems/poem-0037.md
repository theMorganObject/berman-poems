    		  Peyote Tea -  May 1976

Marcus and I  
high on peyote tea  
walking north along  
the narrow road  
that hugs the coast  
from Westhaven to  
Trinidad  
no cars  
just the sea air  
the alders  
the Pacific  
glassy blue  
glimpsed sometimes  
through the trees

Our spirits soaring  
with the tea  
the air  
the spring wildflowers  
the quickening life  
above, below  
and everywhere around us  
and we two free  
to wander as we chose

Then coming toward us  
down the road  
an old man  
Yurok from his appearance  
native to this place  
his people had called  
Tsurai long before  
the Spanish came  
in seventeen seventy-five  
and then the Russians  
for furs and finally  
the settlers and the  
so-called Indian wars

Holding a paper bag  
and sipping from the bottle  
the bag held  
whisky we imagined  
but didn't ask  
he walked right up  
and with a smile  
that stretched wide  
across his face  
he asked in singsong  
voice "How far you goin'  
a tousen mile?"

And we thought we were high!  
but this old man  
was so far past us  
we could only laugh

and wish him well  
as he walked  
down the road  
his question though  
came back to me  
from time to time  
that summer  
like a song  
as I hitchhiked the Kenai  
down to Homer  
and rode the train  
Fairbanks and Denali  
"How far you goin'? A tousen  
mile?"
