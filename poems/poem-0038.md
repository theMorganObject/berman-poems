Netflix/My Octopus Teacher

This is one smart mollusc  
eluding predatory sharks  
with an eight-armed  
arsenal of tricks  
how could she  
possibly be  
cousin to clams and scallops  
my guess is that the secret  
was giving up the shell  
coming out into the open  
with that vulnerable body  
had to get inventive  
sea-smart in a hurry  
no time to waste  
only three years  
to work it out  
that's assuming she can give  
her predators the slip  
and makes it through to mating  
then she can let it go  
let the sharks take  
her body  
used up by now with brooding  
her half million precious eggs

While stunning it wasn't  
the intelligence that moved me most  
it was the trust  
established over time  
between two creatures  
man and mollusc  
species so distant  
you'd think alien  
reaching out to touch  
to hold eachother  
with their so different  
arms and hands  
and one more thing  
the moment  
caught on camera  
of her playing  
like a kitten with  
a ball of yarn  
clearly exited  
playing with a passing  
school of fish

    		My Octopus Teacher - What I Learned

lesson one

if you can't shake  
the shark that's on your tail  
jump on its back  
and hold on for dear life  
don't let go until it's safe  
to sidle off and hide  
under a rock that looks  
a lot like you

lesson two

When you're safe  
in shallow water  
away from your  
predators  
and there's a school  
of gaudy fish  
clustering around you  
throw up your arms  
and swim with them  
fling your body  
up and down  
delight in weightlessness  
it's time to play

lesson three

At the end of the adventure  
with the sharks at last outwitted  
and you've done all  
you know to do  
to further what's most precious  
it's natural to let it go  
death is no punishment  
nothing to fear now  
as oh so gently you rejoin  
the elemental ocean

lesson four

to be smart  
like an octopus  
you must relinquish  
your shell  
take your chances  
out in the free-swimming  
world while learning it all  
on the go  
no moment to waste  
it goes by like a flash  
and the little sharks  
come for you  
eager and fast  
but It helps if you know  
how to sideshift  
how to wrap yourself up  
in the kelp  
in the shells  
how to change colors  
to look like the rocks  
you hide under and  
best to keep eyes  
open wide  
let go of your losses  
with time even  
limbs can regrow

lesson five

How to reconnect  
with the wildness  
with the wild child  
you were once  
upon a time  
that magic child  
you left behind  
as you moved  
into your life

How to rediscover  
that part of you that knows  
it's place, your place  
within the living fabric  
no outsiders  
all the planet  
all life moving  
together in the dance

It's a journey of return  
with many doors  
to enter through  
one is the living ocean  
and this man  
diving in the kelp forest  
discovered through his patience  
his perseverence an entire world  
that for a while became his own  
the world of an octopus  
who once she knew  
that he was not a threat  
reached out to him  
wrapping her suckers  
around his hand and lying  
for a brief moment  
on his chest  
he followed her  
daily to the very end  
she brought him back  
to where he felt alive again  
part of the whole  
which is our only wholeness
