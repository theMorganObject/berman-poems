lesson one

if you can't shake  
the shark that's on your tail  
jump on its back  
and hold on for dear life  
don't let go until it's safe  
to sidle off and hide  
under a rock that looks  
a lot like you

lesson two

When you're safe  
in shallow water  
away from predators  
and there's a school  
of gaudy fish  
clustering around you  
throw up your arms  
and swim with them  
fling your body  
up and down  
delight in weightlessness  
it's time to play

lesson three

At the end of the adventure  
the sharks finally outwitted  
and you've done all  
you know to do  
to further what's most precious  
which is your offspring  
then it's natural to let it go  
nothing to fear as gently you rejoin  
the elemental ocean

lesson four

to be smart  
like an octopus  
you must give up  
your shell  
take your chances  
out in the free-swimming  
world while learning on the go  
no moment to waste  
it goes by like a flash  
the little sharks come for you  
eager and fast  
but It helps if you know  
how to sideshift  
wrap yourself in kelp  
how to change colors  
to look like the rocks  
you hide under and  
best to keep eyes open wide  
let go of losses  
with time even limbs can regrow

lesson five

How to reconnect with that wild child  
the magic child you left behind  
mostly forgottenas you moved  
into your life

How to rejoin the part of you  
that knows it's place  
your place within the planet's skein  
where all of life's enmeshed  
where all are dancing  
to the selfsame tune

It's a journey of return with many doors  
one is the living ocean  
here's a man who diving in the kelp  
entered a world that for a year or two  
became his own  
world of an octopus  
who once she knew  
he posed no threat  
reached out  
wrapping her arm around his hand  
and for a precious moment  
lay across his chest

He followed her to her life's end  
she brought him back to where  
he felt alive again  
part of the living whole  
our only wholeness
