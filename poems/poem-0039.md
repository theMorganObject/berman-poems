One time in Santa Fe  
a man from India  
told me he'd been  
only travelling through  
when the saint came to him

Came in a dream  
Francis for whose holy faith  
the city was named  
and told him to stay

A different dream  
had taught him  
his ayurvedic calling  
after his mother disappeared

She'd chosen to leave  
the home life to follow  
the path of a wandering  
seeker of truth

She announced it  
and was gone  
never sw her again  
but when his father took sick  
she showed up in a dream  
pointed out a plant  
in the backyard garden  
gave detailed instructions  
for its use

After that meeting  
in Santa Fe  
the same day  
I dreamt of two star spirits  
who said they'd come to show me  
the journey of the soul  
after death.

They took me on a flight  
through the planetary spheres  
out to the farthest limits  
of our solar system  
there were things the soul must learn  
before the final leap  
into the fearful distances  
beyond the sun's reach

The planets each had  
their differing natures  
their colors, correspondences  
vibrational frequencies  
from Mercury and Venus  
past Saturn and Neptune  
each planet served as nursery  
for fledgling human souls

As the dream was ending  
the two spirits taking leave  
they chanted a verse  
that I'd long since forgotten  
but now it's come back to me  
a sort of rhyming mantra  
meant to be repeated  
until sound and meaning  
blend and become one

The secret's in the stones  
and you know it in your bones  
how do you find what's in your bones?  
by dancing!  
 (repeat 3x or as needed)
