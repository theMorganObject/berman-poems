A soapstone bowl  
made smooth and round  
with ocean colors  
greens, dark browns  
a short stem carved  
from manzanita  
straight unlike any  
pipe I've seen  
it took a while  
to figure out  
how to use it  
you have to lie  
flat on our back  
feeling the earth  
ready to dream  
tobacco dreams

A Yurok man  
might dream of wealth  
dentalium shells  
red flicker feathers  
obsidian knife  
white deerskin  
a redwood canoe  
carved carefully  
with heart and lungs  
to give it strength  
and wives with  
abalone skirts  
that clinked like  
water over stones  
as they sway  
in the dance

All this and yet  
the greatest wealth  
a man could dream  
might be a song  
that's his alone  
a spirit helper  
for the hunt  
a vision of  
the salmon chief  
leading his tribe  
from Klamath mouth  
upriver to Weitchpek

I keep the pipe  
where I can see it  
above my dresser  
next to a spoon  
of myrtlewood  
perhaps carved by  
the same craftsman  
and other treasures  
from my past  
almost an altar  
these things speak  
to me, remind me  
but of what  
I'm not so sure

Perhaps of how  
whole worlds can rise  
flourish and fade  
for all their beauty  
like languages  
we've lost and still  
are losing daily  
each a human  
world and each  
could be a ship  
that's lost at sea  
with all its passengers  
who now will never  
come to shore

Or else it is  
the simple beauty  
the workmanship  
these things reveal  
spurring me  
to hone my craft  
my music and  
the poetry  
I struggle with  
wishing to have  
something that's worthy  
to pass on  
to those who will  
be coming after  
something to bring  
a smile a moment  
of reflection  
as for me  
this Yurok pipe
