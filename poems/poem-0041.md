Among the ashes that were all the fire  
had left behind my friend who'd lost  
his wife to cancer now his home as well  
was telling me over the phone  
about the cops who'd happened by  
while he was sifting through the rubble

Their German shepherd trained to find the dead  
had found what he'dcome back to search for  
his wife's ashes

He'd planned to scatter them in places  
they had shared and loved  
places that now would hold her memory  
all the more securely  
holding as well her ashes
