Ten p.m.  
the sound of wings  
beating against the window  
just behind my head  
I turned to look  
Rachel I said  
there's an owl  
we had been talking on the phone  
long distance

No hesitation on her part  
her words  
ask what it's bringing  
what it wants to take away

I ran out outside  
no owl in sight  
next morning though  
sitting in medition  
it was back  
not physically this time  
there was a place  
it wanted me to go

A place a mile  
from where I lived  
or maybe two  
above the beach  
hidden by trees  
thick underbrush

when I crawled through  
on hands and knees  
I found myself  
looking down a hundred feet  
through a great cleft  
a rock split down the center  
like a cliff  
but reaching far  
into the earth

I sat there taken  
with the power of the place  
then in my ear  
my uncle's voice  
It's uncle Hal  
the voice said  
all my life  
I wanted just  
to live on air and now  
I am the air and the sea mist  
that blows along the shore  
and it's so wonderful  
so wonderful
