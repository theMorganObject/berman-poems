It was while walking in the park  
with David that some two dozen  
geese flew past us overhead

And both of us recalled  
and shared a moment when  
we'd seen and heard the flocks  
of wild geese passing in their tens  
of thousands through the Klamath flyway

What had struck David most  
was their sheer number  
and then being told  
that what he'd seen accounted for  
half of the species' worldwide population

For me the memory of what  
I saw and heard stays with me  
like a vision the great flock of geese  
passed so close overhead the sound  
of beating wings was even louder  
than their cries and lasted  
for what seemed an hour  
though only minutes by the clock

And by the time they'd flown  
into the distance  
I was free of all  
the painful thoughts and feelings  
that had promted me  
to drive those fifty miles  
out to the Klamath lakes

But why are we so moved  
by the abundance of the wild  
the Serengeti plains with their  
vast herds of wildebeast  
Alaskan salmon rushing  
in great schools  
upstream to spawn  
the snow geese passing over  
in what seems an endless stream

Is it that we're stirred  
by ancestral memories  
of a less sedentary life  
a freedom lost with farming?  
or is it that we sense  
how fast we're losing  
that abundance  
the disappearance of the wild  
the planet's sixth extinction  
and knowing that it may  
take us with it as well?

Or is it what it's always been  
something intrinsic to our  
human capacity for joy  
our sense of wonder witnessing  
the grace and beauty of the wild  
the world of animals  
and of the wild geese flying over  
in their journeys  
north and south
