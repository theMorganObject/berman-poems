Did people really live in them  
those tiny huts  
black shapes emerging from the level fields  
of white that seemed to stretch on endlessly  
mile after mile as our bus scurried north  
from Moscow through the windblown snow

The churches flaunted golden domes and guarded  
the treasured icons of Rublev  
and others from the time Vladimir  
was Russia's center  
seat of the tsar's rule

Twelve hundred thirty-eight  
the year the Mongol horde swept in  
and burned the city  
yet the great churches survived  
or were rebuilt and though the Icon's colors  
have been restored  
they still posess an aura not unlike  
the halos of the saints depicted on them  
their antique spirit though foreign to our world  
still speaks of something that's beyond  
mere history or style or even art

It was Pasternak who wrote Eternity  
should cast its glow among us  
like a Christmas tree with candles  
lighting up the room  
these icons have that power  
bringing to bear a vertical awareness  
amidst the hustle of our horizontal lives
