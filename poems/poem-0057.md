Song of the Arrowheads

My grandpa had a handful  
of beauties that he'd found  
and placed between the chimney stones  
at Phaleron his summer home

That was the house I loved  
more than any as a child  
with swordfish swords perched  
in the kitchen rafters  
and shiny turban shells

Rose bushes beside the door  
and my grandma's zinnias  
and a watermelon patch  
in the garden out in front

In back the patio  
its lattice draped with pink  
and blue and white petunias  
and steps that led out to the bluff

where grandpa's flagpole stood  
mornings he'd raise the flag  
and we'd salute and then at dusk  
he'd lower it again and fold it  
and place it carefully inside its box

The house looked over the lagoon  
some half a mile across  
another mile away the drawbridge  
then the harbor and the Sound

For me the arrowheads were magical  
tokens of another world  
a life I gladly would have chosen  
if there had been a choice

After grandpa died  
my parents sold the house  
without a word to anyone  
we children felt cheated by that loss

I suspect it was my mother  
her feelings never quite resolved  
and then there was her father's  
remarriage late in life

In my dream the house was lifted  
by the rising ocean tide  
carried beyond the harbor  
floating off and out of sight

I like to think after the house sold  
the arrowheads made their way back  
to the trail the Wampanoag  
had once followed along the bluff

In my mind I see them lying  
half buried in the sand  
beside the path where as a boy  
I ran barefoot all summer long
