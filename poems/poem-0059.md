How I hated them  
the cautionary words my father spoke  
don't set your course too high he said  
stay close to me  
we'll keep within a reasonable distance  
of earth's cooling vapors  
don't overreach yourself  
but how could I  
not seize the moment  
after feeling that first exultation  
and oh how close I came  
I could have simply reached out  
and touched the god himself  
source of all earthly life  
our one true father  
no, I have not the least regret  
that single moment  
of ecstasy  
of weightless flight as I began  
my precipitous descent  
was worth whatever price  
even my life
