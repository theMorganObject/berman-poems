I.

Mid-october  
time for these little fiddlers  
to find their winter homes  
though sadly  
hearths are fewer now  
farther between and  
houses harder to enter  
uninvited

At dusk the quiet hum  
of freeway traffic  
in the distance  
closer to hand  
the insect choir  
high pitched  
continuous music

Not a playful sound  
lacking the range of notes  
the exuberance  
of warblers, titmice, chickadees  
but if those insect voices  
should fade from the countryside  
the silence will be  
a hole we've made in heaven

II.

In Kansas City  
years ago  
I bought a book of  
Chinese paintings  
mountains and streams  
the usual subjects  
done in black ink  
beautifully reproduced  
a serious collection

But one stands out for its  
sense of whimsy  
an autumn scene  
cutaway of a house  
a gentleman in bed asleep  
while up the front stairs  
and under the bed  
crickets the size of  
cats or rabbits  
but otherwise realistic  
to the last detail

Easy to grasp  
the artist's humerous intent  
the crickets' outsized presence  
once their voices emanate  
high and shrill under bed  
and between walls

Still there's a subtle difference  
one can sense  
along with all the whimsy  
something that sets this painter's  
art apart from say a Durrer print

It has, I think, to do with seeing  
from within  
not looking from outside  
the world of living things  
seeing with a deep sense of kinship  
familial affection

Our European folktales  
Russian fairy tales  
the Brothers Grimm  
often seem to counsel  
such an attitude toward  
animals including ants  
and fish and birds  
when treated with respect and care  
listened to, their advice heeded  
become allies in the human quest

Song for the crickets O crickets  
 lost in the tall grass  
 on this moonlit night  
 where are your silver homes?  
 where are your golden homes?  
 Yosano Akiko/Steve Berman  
Now it's mid-October  
nights are getting colder  
time for you small fiddlers  
to find your winter homes

I would ask you in  
to share our country place  
but we've up and moved to town  
so now you're on your own

If our new house had a hearth  
or even a woodstove  
we would gladly welcome you  
my wife and I both

But there is a pile of leaves  
and brush out in the pasture  
you could dig down under that  
and wait for warmer weather

There's no time to waste though  
December's just around the bend  
maybe at our neighbor's house  
you will find a place to spend  
the winter snug and cozy  
singing in the woodpile  
when the chilly months are past  
we can meet again
