Dear Ruth  
tomorrow marks nine years exactly  
you were so lovely in your last decades  
each of us four children fought  
to have you at the end  
I was the lucky one

When I wheeled you on the plane  
to bring you here to Oregon  
someone said to me  
if she dies during the flight  
don't say a word or else  
we'll have to land

But you survived the trip  
and the next morning  
when I wheeled you out  
into our livingroom  
and Carroll brought you coffee  
you watched the chickadees  
raiding the feeder  
just outside the window  
you turned to me and said  
Oh Stephen this is perfect!

Three or four days later  
I took you to a doctor  
to get morphine  
so you could sleep at night  
you didn't like the drive  
and when the doctor said  
Ruth it's been a pleasure  
and I hope to see you again  
you answered with your usual  
spunk and spirit  
"well I certainly hope not!"

After you died  
I seemed to see the world  
through your eyes  
noticing as never before  
the little things  
birds, flowers, insects  
rocks and leaves  
the world that your loved most  
and just today  
while visiting a friend  
whose wife announced that she  
was separating iris tubers  
and would I like to take some  
I thought of how  
through all my childhood every fall  
you'd be out in the garden  
on hands and knees
