Ollie our orange Maine coon cat  
looks through the french door  
sees the dog  
sprawled on the rug  
goes back to stalking  
birds and lizards  
in the garden

Save for the two old dogs  
our scruffy poodles  
sleeping soundly  
no-one's home  
but me

The stillness of the house  
contrasts with what I'm seeing  
out the window  
maple and acacia branches  
swaying madly  
leaves aflutter  
trembling wildly in the breeze

Cat Stevens sang it years ago  
baby it's a wild wild world  
and maybe even more so  
now than then

But as if in defiance of  
the world's windy commotion  
its mad hurly-burly  
this day brings  
an unexpected hour  
of inner calm  
of peace unearned  
and undeserved  
but welcomed  
treasured all the more  
for that

I credit Carroll  
thoughtful wife  
who found this house  
our canine kids  
our Ollie cat  
and goes on finding  
me in all the places  
where I'm most alive
