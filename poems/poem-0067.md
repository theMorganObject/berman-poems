Mamalilikulla  
 with my son Daniel  
 spring 1992

Long after we stumbled on it  
paddling our sea kayaks  
out in Johnstone Strait  
it was still showing up  
in my dreams  
a fog-shrouded island  
the village long abandoned  
totem poles rotting on the ground  
a place of memory  
of power

I'd read they had a potlatch  
in nineteen twenty-one  
when Canada was still  
stealing children  
still working to uproot  
the native languages  
cultural traditions

They sent out the police  
to shut it down  
arrest the people gathered there  
after all we can't have folks  
just giving wealth away  
it's unchristian  
not to say uncivilized

Today it's different  
the people have reclaimed  
their name kwakwaka'wakw  
are working to restore  
what was destroyed  
the potlatch has come back  
the carving skills  
cedar canoes  
dances and songs  
and with them  
native pride

One year in Seattle  
at the spring folklife festival  
I saw the great canoes  
carved from a single cedar trunk  
prows that rose above my head  
the native carvers demonstrating  
their art, their skill  
and me being a singer  
I asked about the paddling songs  
the answer came  
swift as a paddle stroke  
those songs I leave back home  
back in my village
