Each day that passes  
sand is slipping  
throught the hourglass

Soon there may be  
no-one left  
to turn it over

I ask myself  
without a future  
is this world real?

Or a play  
unfolding past  
the final curtain?

Walking around  
the town it all  
seems strangely normal

save for the masks  
people are doing  
the usual things

Then why do I  
feel like I'm looking  
at the past

A world of ghosts  
actors in some  
strange afterlife?

Is this what's meant  
by those who say  
it's all illusion?

Or is this rather  
the last chapter of our  
overly successful run?

There's no end to  
the beauty that  
still saves the world

The children's faces  
smiling fresh  
as nodding flowers

If I'm a ghost  
Halloween will  
be here soon enough

I suspect I have  
some trick-or-treating  
still to do
