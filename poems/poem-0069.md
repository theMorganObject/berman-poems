The nursery  
half an hour from town  
had landscape trees  
thirty feet tall  
I came looking for this small  
persimmon tree

Four months later  
she has grown a foot or more  
branched out and stands there  
fully clothed in late October

Proclaims herself  
the ornament of our back yard  
her pale green leaves  
that with the cold  
have turned to paler orange

The leaves, nearly translucent  
standing out against the grey brick wall  
seeming to glow with their own light  
wings of an angel

And like an angel visitor  
this little tree compels  
my rapt attention  
brings the soft light  
of eternity into  
our livingroom
