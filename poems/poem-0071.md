    	                    			1911-2009

Here was a man  
loved working on Peugeots  
loved his many grandkids  
loved hiking in the Trinities  
not over educated  
but a lifelong learner  
a genial companion  
with whom I shared a bus ride  
from Billings Montana  
down to Nicaragua  
that was an adventure  
we're unlikely to forget

Without his son's girlfriend  
we never would have made it  
she was the one who owned  
a San Diego car lot  
installed a new radiator  
found a couple of spare tires  
those were the two things  
that saw us through the trip

Back in his teens  
Jesse was an outlaw  
carried a gun to school  
could have ended up in jail  
somehow he found  
good teachers to help him  
put his life in order  
came back to the West  
found a strong woman  
to marry and leaving  
behind the evangelicals  
chose the Unitarians  
a more accepting faith

Born to missionaries  
in the Belgian Congo  
no place for a baby  
in 1911  
so his folks booked passage  
on the latest liner  
a ship called the Titanic  
and we know the rest  
but as luck would have it  
their ferry hit a sandbar  
on the Congo River  
and they missed the boat

Thinking it over it  
makes a strong case  
for a kind of equanimity  
facing all kinds of luck  
Jesse had that quality  
living in the moment  
thoughtful appreciation  
never slow to laugh

I like to think on the  
stories he told me  
one about his grandma  
she was only twelve  
the older of two daughters  
but no helpless child  
when a prairie fire threatened  
to destroy their Kansas farm

Her parents away in town  
she saw smoke in the distance  
ran to the barn  
hitched the horses to a plough  
made furrows all around the house  
and when the fire came through  
it left the farmhouse standing  
with burnt fields on every side  
says Jess that was my grandma  
never at a loss

Jesse was a lumberman  
worked in the woods  
a faller who I think had seen  
men killed on the job  
by the time I met him  
he was ready to retire  
wanted me to teach him  
classical guitar  
this was a pleasure  
I like to think for both of us  
exploring the music  
of the Spanish master  
beautiful melodies of  
Fernando Sor

Jesse was the one  
introduced me to the Trinities  
we had some sweet times  
hiking the high country  
I'd had no experience  
of backpacking until then  
this was a revelation  
a deep and lasting joy

Once when we were hiking  
below Sapphire Lake  
I heard beside the trail  
the dry buzz of a rattlesnake  
Jesse just ahead of me  
kept moving toward the sound  
I grabbed him by the shoulders  
he hadn't heard a thing  
he'd lost a lot of hearing  
working in a lumber mill  
that snake gave us a moment  
something to talk and laugh about

Raised by his grandparents  
Jesse was a goldmine  
of antique expressions  
words to bring a smile  
"steep as a horses face"  
"safe as in God's pocket"  
he always knew the right  
time to pull them out

Jesse lived a long life  
died at ninety-seven  
I'd moved away by then  
we'd hardly stayed in touch  
I came with my wife  
for the memorial celebration  
lots of folks I recognized  
lots of moving tributes  
I said very little  
finding it difficult  
to speak of someone  
who has meant so much
