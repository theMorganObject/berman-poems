We speak of leaves  
turning to red and gold  
is that what Moses saw?  
if so I see it too  
in every tree  
or bush with leaves aflame  
touched by the artist's brush  
each leaf a tiny  
guarantor of eternity

In deeper truth  
the brilliant autumn colors  
lie hidden all along  
behind the green  
that fills the living world  
the green that gives us  
what we need to breathe  
to burn with lust  
and love  
run after prey  
to hold at last  
our children  
in our arms

If green is life  
the autumn colors signal  
whatever power transcends  
even this world  
of life and breath  
and causes us to marvel  
at the beauty of the light  
caught in the leaves

Here is the human gift  
that moves us out  
beyond ourselves  
to where the world surpasses  
our every effort to contain it  
in our words  
our works our art  
even our praise
