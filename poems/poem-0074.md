Uncle Joe  
we never really knew eachother  
but I can still remember  
how you loved puns  
and joking at the dinner table  
and how one time you gave me  
a fine fishing reel

Decades after your death  
you came  
into my dreams  
eyes sparkling  
as if holding back  
some funny joke  
some marvellous secret

You walked right up to me  
I said "but uncle Joe  
it's been some forty years!"  
and he said "no  
I never died  
I've just been hiding  
just been hiding out"
