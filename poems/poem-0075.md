A cold October night  
all's quiet  
save for our kitty  
miaowing plaintively  
at the back door

After a while my wife  
only a touch exasperated  
gently orders me  
to leave the couch  
and let him in

Now he's purring in my ear  
rubbing his cheek  
against my cheek  
tickling my neck  
with his soft fluffy tail

And I've completely lost  
whatever I was thinking  
prior to this onslaught  
of unsolicited affection

An unexpected but  
not wholly unwelcome  
complement to the night's  
burden of lethargy  
and calm

Which has returned  
now that he's sleeping  
in a ball beside me  
dead out in the way  
only a cat can do
