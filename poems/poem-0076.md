Moving into winter days  
I marvel at the neighbor's maple  
reaching high above our roof  
the dark boughs hidden  
tucked behind what was till now  
a mass of solid green  
and overnight has turned  
to a pale green and yellow cloud  
soon the unleaved limbs  
will show themselves  
gray tracery  
against the paler sky

This is the month my mother died  
it's been nine years  
sometimes it seems  
like yesterday and other times  
it seems so long ago I can't  
bring back the feelings  
though the images of her are clear

My father's death  
came only three weeks later  
though in a different year  
no wonder as the winter looms  
I feel myself turn back  
to embrace and mourn  
even as I celebrate  
my holy dead

Though family comes first  
then lovers  
friends and teachers  
and some whose lives  
merely brushed mine  
but left something  
that over years  
still brings them back to mind

One on whom I meditate  
not knowing  
where to place her  
is the child  
we would have had  
and loved  
my first wife and I  
had she not miscarried  
she was working  
I was struggling  
to write my thesis  
and the child  
who'd brought us  
to decide on marriage  
left suddenly  
unmourned  
I mourn her now  
and ponder what her life  
might have been like  
had she not turned back  
still in the womb  
and how my life  
would have been changed  
enriched and challenged

After this my wife chose  
not to have another child  
had this child lived  
our marriage might have lasted  
past its four year stretch  
hard to imagine now  
this fall would have seen  
her fifty-fourth birthday  
turned back so soon to stardust  
as we all shall be  
I grieve our loss  
only now  
belatedly
