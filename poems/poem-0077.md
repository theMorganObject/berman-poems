Seventy-seven  
never thought I'd make it  
but that's a common view  
of twenty somethings  
now that I'm here  
I'm standing on a hilltop  
surveying the terrain  
that stretches on  
in all directions  
save perhaps for one

The present has  
at last revealed itself  
infinite in its beauty  
its transcendence  
emptied of ambition  
it issues forth  
from its deep source  
rising and flowing freely  
ceaselessly

the past  
left heedlessly behind  
as I rushed forward  
is now transformed  
into a treasure chest of memories  
each one as precious as  
a wedding ring  
a sapphire bracelet  
a kingdom  
in a Russian fairytale

The future  
my own end  
a wave  
out there on  
the horizon  
moving swiftly  
smoothly  
still far off and wholly  
without malice  
simply one  
of countless others  
this one coming  
just for me  
to take me back  
into the ocean  
father/mother  
of us all
