Stingy Jack you clever rogue  
only Ireland's rocky soil  
could have birthed you  
who but you  
had what it takes  
to share a glass  
of uisce beatha  
with Old Scratch  
and make him pay the bill

Lacking cash the Tempter turned  
himself into a silver coin  
which you then slipped into your pocket  
held him hostage with a cross

And when you set him free  
the deal was he would let you  
live in peace another year  
and never claim you soul

If that were not enough  
again you tricked him  
this time up a tree  
to pick some fruit  
then carved a cross  
not letting him descend

Until he had agreed to grant you  
ten more years of grace  
all that you needed to  
live out your life in peace

But then the Good Lord  
would not let you enter His  
celestial kingdom  
judging you too much a rascal  
and a rogue

Likewise the Old Deceiver  
blocked your entrance  
into his dark dungeon  
holding fast to what you'd  
made him swear

So with a burning coal  
set in a turnip  
you were forced to wander  
over hills and moors  
a lost soul  
scaring country folk

And so we have  
Jack o' the lantern  
fearsome faces carved  
into a pumpkin  
with a candle set  
to make an eerie orange glow

Jack o'lantern faces that no longer  
scare a single soul but  
keep the ghosts and goblins  
at a distance and delight  
the trick-or-treaters  
little witches, warlocks,  
zombies, superheroes  
that this night  
of Halloween  
come knocking  
at our door
