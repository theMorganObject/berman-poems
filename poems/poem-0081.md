The year after my father died  
I put togther an ofrenda  
candles candies fruits  
papel picado little calaveras  
family photos  
an offering felt deeply  
at the time  
but unrepeated  
all these years

This evening of All Souls Day  
final day of Dia de los Muertos  
my son has texted that his uncle  
Steve has died  
on the Big Island  
his longtime Hawaian home

I remember him just vaguely  
tall, blond, slender  
a quick mind and wit  
like his older sister  
still my wife when  
in the eighties  
we flew out  
to visit him

Later Steve and his wife  
Teresa sent us honey  
from beehives they hid  
in the Ohia forest

Pure white  
the most amazing flavor  
I looked forward to  
the packages from Hilo  
spoon it like icecream  
from the plastic jug

Crimson of the Ohia blossoms  
black basalt of the lava soil  
pure white of the ohia honey  
colors of the triple goddess  
maiden mother crone  
Pele has taken back the son  
she lured long years ago  
from Kansas  
Steve Oldfather  
rest in peace
