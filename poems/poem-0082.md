Thin clouds bright sky  
the morning dawns  
the whole world waits  
will he be gone  
the one who mocks  
democracy  
would silence those  
who take note  
of his constant lies

How can so many  
of my countrymen  
and women fail  
to notice who  
this man in fact  
is working for  
and how much harm  
he's done in four  
short years

But neither side  
is mentioning  
the one big thing  
the inconvenient  
truth about the  
climate though  
the planet's warming  
linked to more  
destructive  
fires  
floods  
typhoons  
presages  
a less hospitable planet  
darkly different from  
the one we've known

No mere elephant  
in the room  
this one will pluck  
the whole house  
off its weak foundation  
roll it down the hill  
and likely we've already  
passed the moment  
when we might have  
saved our children  
from the coming storm
