His dharma teacher called him Crooked Cucumber  
for the produce farmers scattered by the road  
on route to market  
discarding what they thought  
was too ugly, too misshapen  
to sell

I'd read his book  
Zen Mind Beginner's Mind  
brief oral teachings  
each one bristling  
with Zen wisdom  
each casting light  
on what had been  
in shadow

Nothing easy  
about his early life  
a wife murdered by someone  
he'd invited in  
a daughter in a mental institution  
the menial work he'd chosen  
as his path

But when he spoke  
at a gathering near San Jose  
his voice was clear  
completely free of self  
like a cool breeze  
blowing through pine boughs

And when he paused and smiled  
it seemed as if  
his smile had swallowed  
not just the room  
but the entire universe

Once at Tassahara  
in the hills south of Carmel  
I saw him moving stones  
building a rock wall  
he invited me to join him  
and the others there  
but I wished to be alone  
and so declined

Remembering that moment  
I feel a faint regret  
a certain sadness  
even after half a century  
I learned later  
that he loved  
working with stone  
who knows what  
I might have learned  
working with him
