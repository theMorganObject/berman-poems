    	Influenza

Even a flu shot  
can be a metaphor  
the higher dose  
hurts more  
but makes more antibodies  
and I for one  
need all the white  
blood cells  
that I can muster  
to counteract  
the ills  
life throws my way

After the shot  
my arm is sore  
but now I'm ready  
to counter  
this years flu  
though not the Covid  
I'm praying that one  
passes me and all  
my loved ones by

At least I'm not alone  
as many are  
through this long year  
of plague that isolates us  
from friends  
from family  
from those we love  
to go for months  
without another's touch  
has become  
a commonplace  
a harsh reality  
and there are worse things  
happening out there  
in nursing homes  
in hospitals  
among the old  
those who suffer from dementia  
from a sense  
of having been abandoned  
who can't understand  
why they've been deprived  
the comfort of familiar faces  
of children come to visit

No antibodies for that kind  
of sickness  
for Alzheimers  
for loneliness  
or for the grief  
of those who've lost  
parent or partner  
someone precious  
so we can pray  
for a vaccine  
but also for  
the courage  
and compassion  
we each need  
to come through this  
harsh time  
no less forgiving  
of our adversaries  
by which I mean ourselves  
and come through  
possibly more human  
in our shared grief  
for what's been lost  
and in our gratitude  
for all that still calls out  
for celebration
