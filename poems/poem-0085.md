He never taught  
a universal doctrine  
only that  
within the fourfold world  
all men are brothers  
(and so all women sisters)  
thus a deep respect  
a reverence for others  
is the true expression  
of our study  
our self-cultivation

Once in my lifetime  
I was blessed to witness  
this teaching  
this philosophy  
in action  
it was in Bogota, Colombia  
my thirty-third birthday  
my brother chose  
a Chinese restaurant

After the meal we left  
and walked maybe  
three city blocks  
when I remembered  
the package I'd forgotten  
books wrapped  
in colored paper with a ribbon

As we turned to head back  
an old man came running  
a Chinese gentleman  
who bowed before me deeply  
both hands extended  
as he offered me  
the package I had left

There was something in this  
gentleman's demeanor  
that touched my soul  
that I've never forgotten  
as if he knew  
the import of his gesture  
in itself a teaching  
worthy of the master  
at once humble and dignified  
and certain  
in the knowledge  
that the greatest virtue lies  
in honoring the other  
as one would be honored
