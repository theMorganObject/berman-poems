Our new vice-president  
mother from India  
father Jamaican  
didn't we all come here  
from somewhere else?  
If not ourselves or parents  
then some ancestor  
whose journey  
made us natives of this place

At heart we are a migratory species  
and now we celebrate this truth  
with a strong woman  
who is already working  
to guide our nation  
back toward some  
semblance of sanity  
of reconciliation  
between warring factions  
that have set  
neighbor against neighbor  
doing only harm  
while encouraging  
the sale of guns

Welcome Kamala!
