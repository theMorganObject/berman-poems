There's something in us  
eager to be first  
first to climb Everest  
first to reach the moon  
first in line for groceries  
for gas  
first to date the captain  
of the football team  
the cheerleader whose smile  
entices most

My dharma teacher counseled  
being last  
and Jesus too  
the last shall be the first  
to come into my kingdom  
so the gospel

But something of the child  
in each of us  
wants to know  
who is it you love more  
me or my sister  
me or my older brother  
and why can't I go first  
I'm just as strong  
just as smart, as brave  
as lovable

If only we could all be  
the wise parent  
who knows what words  
to use to soothe that child  
what gestures serve to satisfy  
the hunger  
that courses deep  
in every human soul

Then being first might mean  
first to reach out  
ones hand in peace  
in friendship  
first to strive  
for justice in an unjust world  
first to heal  
who stands in need of healing  
first to share  
the light and laughter  
of one's soul
