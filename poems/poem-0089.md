My wife's beloved nana  
daughter of a Garibaldi  
Longobard name  
meaning bold spearsman  
came on her own  
to California  
in nineeteen hundred three  
from this small village  
in the hills  
just inland from  
the Cinque Terre  
and the Ligurian Sea

She was twelve then  
was joining an older  
half-sister in San Francisco  
now all these years later  
we had found the house  
she'd lived in as a girl  
and sure enough  
just as she'd told  
her grand-daughter  
there was the church  
up on the hill  
above the house  
seen front and center  
through the upstairs  
bedroom window

From the outside  
the church was nondescript  
but when we entered  
for a Sunday mass  
what a surprise  
the walls  
the entire ceiling  
filled with lovely artworks  
paintings of a baroque master  
whose name we failed to learn

Only a handful of the faithful  
attending mass that morning  
but the priest intoned the Latin  
with a warm resonant voice  
that needed no amplification  
to fill up the church with solemn  
and incantatory sound

The service over  
ushered to a side room  
we saw books with yellowed pages  
lined up on high shelf  
the priest and our new friend  
a local geneologist  
helped us search the records  
scrawled in faded ink  
births, baptisms, marriages  
and deaths that went back  
in time before Napoleon  
initiated public record keeping

Looking for family history  
for names and dates connecting us  
to this small village  
to this church  
where my wife's nana  
had come as a girl  
with parents, brothers, family  
sat perhaps in the same pew  
where we had sat  
all that was deeply meaningful  
though neither she nor I  
confessed a Christian faith  
it seemed this church  
had brought the two of us  
one long step closer  
to the mystery  
the silence  
to the only god we knew
