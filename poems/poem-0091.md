This apple tree  
must be the one  
that Eve stole from  
in that first garden  
Gan Eden  
Garden of Delight  
the fruit so sweet  
so luscious once  
the first fall frost  
has turned the pink  
and yellow globes  
to sugar candy  
that the Creator  
must have known  
they never could  
or would resist  
those two  
from whom we all  
have learned  
to savor sweetness  
all the more  
when there is just  
a hint of tartness  
in our love  
as in the taste  
of these sweet fujis
