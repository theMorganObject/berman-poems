Today marks thirteen years  
yet it feels an age ago  
I've only now begun to understand  
just how alone my father was  
excepting for his wife  
my mother  
and even she  
could only reach so far  
into his cloistered world

I remember her telling me  
after a friends' husband died  
how the friend had told her  
that the saddest part was feeling  
she had never known him  
never known her husband  
of so many years

What does this knowing look like  
what paths lead  
into that clearing  
that opening in the forest  
of our hearts  
where our loved ones can enter  
and then later tell themselves  
they truly knew us

I don't imagine that my mother  
felt the sadness of not knowing  
only the longing  
to be back with him again  
in the next life

I picture them today in the next world  
continuing their loving verbal tennis match  
sipping coffee reading the celestial  
New York Times  
my father with his  
Ruth how could you ever  
be so stupid!  
and my mother  
Harold just because  
you know a lot of things  
don't forget  
you cast your vote  
for Nixon!
