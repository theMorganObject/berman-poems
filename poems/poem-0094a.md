(nyckel = key / harpa = fiddle)

Bosse Karlsson made for me  
this marvellous viola  
that can play in tune  
thanks to three rows of keys  
or tangents set in place  
to stop the strings  
at proper intervals  
a boon to Swedish farmers  
fingers stiff from fieldwork  
or perhaps like me  
too lazy or too late  
to learn the violin

But it's more than ease  
of playing  
it's the quality of sound  
delights both audience  
and player  
it's the added resonance  
almost harp-like  
of sympathetic strings  
that form a sonic aura  
round each note  
played by the bow

After six hundred years  
it disappeared  
until one man  
revived it from the dead  
Eric Sahlstrom who  
taught his countrymen  
the secrets of construction  
and the art  
of making this folk fiddle  
come alive

Now it's moved out  
beyond its native land  
across the planet  
even here in Oregon  
it has its coterie  
of players  
folkies like me  
who love its tonal palette  
love the tunes  
some sad and soulful  
some that set  
both heart and feet  
dancing to Swedish polskas
