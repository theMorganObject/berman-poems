In the gray autumnal afternoon  
our bonfires gleam  
bright orange  
flames leap high  
under the oaks  
burn greedily through piles  
of brush  
pine branches  
blackberries  
and leaves  
we've gathered  
since the end of summer

The smoke blows one way  
then the other  
in the shifting breeze  
the scent is equally  
acrid and sweet  
and brings to mind  
scenes of a distant childhood  
memories long unbidden  
another coast  
the family home  
outside of Boston  
the crisp New England air  
and leaves  
raked into mounds  
that burned and smouldered  
with the autumn's  
pungent fragrance  
the selfsame fragrance  
that now conjurs up  
a young boy's exultation  
as he dives  
into leaf piles  
just for the wanton joy of it
