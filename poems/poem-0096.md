Son of a noble family  
you rose quickly  
perhaps too soon  
in the bright glitter  
of Chang-an  
the Tang's great capitol

Exiled for your part  
in an effort  
to push back against corruption  
at the court  
you found yourself  
a thousand miles from home  
from family and friends  
from all you'd known

Lost among hill tribes  
men who wore tattoes  
and spoke their uncouth  
native languages  
you did your best  
to give a human face  
to the empire's  
administrative presence

In your grief you found  
a certain solace  
in the trees you loved  
and planted  
pomegranites  
bamboos, plums  
tree peonies  
two hundred orange trees  
hoping for a grove  
and looking to the fruit  
to nourish you  
in later years  
you wouldn't live  
to see

In idleness you wandered  
through the countryside  
taking in the beauty  
the exotic south  
exploring hills and streams  
sharing your insights  
griefs, exultations  
loneliness and loves  
in poems sent to friends  
to the companions of your youth  
and fellow exiles  
as we used to send letters  
in the mail

After your death the viilagers  
to honor you  
built a pavilion  
which they named  
Fragrance of Oranges  
and made a memorial  
gravesite by the pond  
you used to frequent

Of all your poems  
there is one that's known  
by every Chinese schoolgirl  
yet no translator  
seems to have grasped its secrets  
you called it River Snow  
in it you evoke  
the heavy snowfall  
that fell in 807  
in the south  
a rare event  
that prompted you to write

A thousand snowy mountains  
block the flight of birds  
and human footsteps  
melt into a myriad paths  
while on the river  
a lone skiff  
and in it  
straw caped and capped  
a solitary fisherman  
old geyser  
angling the river snow

This image coming down  
twelve centuries  
painted a thousand times  
by Chinese artists  
I see it clearly as your own  
self-portrait  
a metaphor for your poetic self  
angling in your solitude for words  
that might convey the beauty  
you experience  
beauty, words, experience  
all fleeting as snowflakes  
falling on the river
