after Liu Tsung-yuan

Yesterday after a long dry season  
the pond began to fill  
I grabbed a rake  
pulled weeds and leaves out of the feeder stream  
that runs along our fence  
I've never known exactly where the water comes from  
only that it flows down from the hills above

All summer long the pond was a brown basin  
of dry cracked mud  
now once again the shimmering surface  
reflects the life that lines the bank  
blackthorn and elder  
ash and oregon grape  
a blur of green bamboo  
the pond a watercolor  
rendered by Monet

Overnight the landscape has regained  
what it had lost to summer's drought  
a mirror hiding the murky depths  
that nurture tadpoles, turtles, frogs and fish  
food for long-legged herons  
loudmouthed kingfishers

The rising waters  
dark under dark skies  
nourish what is most alive in us  
teaching our minds to dance as the pond dances  
its surface glinting in the midday rain light
