All day out in the pasture  
starting with paper trash  
and cardboard boxes  
a splash of gasoline  
to get it going  
and then the brush and brambles  
soaked by the recent rains  
but still able to catch  
and bigger limbs  
that fell from the big oaks  
during the windstorm  
that swept through a week ago  
trunks of small trees  
that last year floated  
in the pond  
making a sunny porch  
for native turtles  
and then were left behind  
when the pond dried  
now it's full again  
thanks to the feeder stream  
gurgling over stones  
in a mad rush  
to merge with the still waters  
and quick to take advantage  
of that quiet refuge  
today the ducks were back

One might think it boring  
tending a fire  
all the long afternoon  
and into evening  
which comes early now  
in late November  
but no  
there's something so compelling  
about watching how the flames  
play in the breeze  
as if alive  
how the smoke  
rises and shifts direction  
with the wind  
how the wet wood hisses  
how the embers  
glow and snap  
and settle into coals

Is it because for half a million years  
we've tended fires like this one  
seeking the warmth  
the heat for cooking  
and at night  
the light to keep at bay  
the predatory demons  
whether real  
or creatures of our fantasy  
and to create a hearth  
where we could sit  
and share the stories of the day  
the hunt  
the sight of bison herds  
of mammoths  
and other tales  
of how the world was formed  
how the first men and women  
came to be  
so much the fire taught us  
in those early days  
and still it has the power  
to feed my mind  
to hold my gaze steady  
on the glowing coals  
I am its child  
and will be till the time  
I give my body back  
to the cleansing flames
