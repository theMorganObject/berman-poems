Crab boats sheltering behind the Head  
buck on their moorings  
ride the winter swells  
the fishermen begrudge the stormy weather  
the crabs are happy  
just to keep their shells

Taking my kayak out past Pilot Rock  
I watch the orange sea stars  
clinging fast  
to the rock face as the waters rise  
and fall with every wave  
that rushes past

The clanging bell buoy's gloomy monotone  
pierces the fog bank  
warns of hidden shoals  
steers the sailor homeward so that he  
won't be the one  
for whom the churchbell tolls

I spoke once with a fisherman whose boat  
was drydocked now  
he'd reached that last great shoal  
he said he'd dreamed a golden skeleton  
an image fit  
for his immortal soul

He told me that in all the storms he'd weathered  
he'd never lost a crewman  
to the seas  
and of all the memories he treasured  
that knowledge gave his mind  
the greatest ease

The lighthouse used to stand out on the Head  
two hundred feet above  
the ocean's rise  
the keeper's log in eighteen eighty-nine  
mentions "a sea of most unusual size"

That rose high up the rock face and put out  
the lamp  
now that was surely quite a "sea"  
but it's the keeper's understated tone  
speaks of a different sensibility

In younger years I used to climb the Head  
with my friend Jesse Moon  
good company  
we'd listen to the sea lions in the distance  
barking on their Flatiron rookery

Jesse's gone on before me  
in my mind  
his shade still walks the trail  
he used to clear  
as if in some imagined afterlife  
he visits still the place  
he held so dear

The Head gives shelter from prevailing winds  
but south storms can wreak havok  
piling boats  
right up on the beach below the dock  
tossing shoreward  
anything that floats

Before the Spanish captain named the place  
back in seventeen hundred seventy-five  
the Yurok village had been there for centuries  
they called it Tsurai  
some are still alive

Whose grandparents remembered  
the old ways  
the language - mostly gone  
but the songs last  
I wonder by what name it will be known  
in future ages  
when our time is past
