(for reciting with soft drumming)

The armies of darkness  
disguised as conquistadores  
dog-headed demons  
grotesque marauders  
brandishing pikes  
swords, spears and axes  
advance slowly, stealthily  
toward the defenceless  
family of Joseph  
and Mary and their  
holy son

Meanwhile the sweet sounding  
water drums  
beaten with mallets  
give rise to a soft  
steady rythm  
while singers chant  
the ancient deer songs  
invoking a world  
whose ethereal beauty  
echoes the desert  
revived after rain  
but with colors even  
more vivid  
a vision of purity  
while the deer dancer  
a deer's head and antlers  
above his own head  
slowly sways to and fro  
in a trance

And just as the warriors  
are poised to attack  
the friends of Jes√∫s  
unarmed  
few in number  
rush to the great mounds  
of flowers before them  
throw the bright flowers  
at the forces of evil  
and watch as the enemy  
army collapses  
and falls to the ground

It's a teaching  
a vision  
a spirit world seen  
through the eyes of a deer  
who like every messiah is  
quick but no predator  
wary and vulnerable  
worldly and outside this world

And the drama continues unfolding  
before us  
the flower world  
facing the armies so bent  
on destroying  
whatever is precious  
while there at the center  
a dancer  
in trance holds the vision  
that redeems us all
