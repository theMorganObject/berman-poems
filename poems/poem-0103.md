`"Reality isn't just there; it must be  
 searched out and won" P.C.1958

All over the unthinkably  
vast universe the search goes on  
throughout a billion galaxies  
life is looking for what's real  
what's real could be in the next bite  
we take or something takes of us

Fixed in the very stuff of stars  
that finally explode like dandy-  
lions casting out the seeds  
that will give rise to living forms  
creatures that will someday swarm  
and die  
and dying make the soil  
to nurture newer forms  
who says the stars  
aren't searching for reality  
the real is searching for itself  
a playful dog chasing its tail
