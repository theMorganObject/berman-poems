It's like this  
you board a Greyhound bus  
headed for some city  
out on the coast  
and after a few hours  
the bus makes a stop  
at a small town caf√©  
so you get out  
order a slice  
of pie with coffee  
and while you're finishing  
you happen to look up  
in time to see  
the bus pull out  
it's too late now  
you might as well  
finish your coffee  
your piece of pie  
you step outside  
take a look around  
it's all pretty homey  
so you tell yourself  
hey this is good enough  
I might as well  
find myself a room  
stay on awhile  
and see what comes  
next thing you know  
some twenty years  
have come and gone  
your wife's still willing  
to put up with your shit  
the kids near grown  
the coast no closer  
than when you started  
but you might get there  
one of these days  
bring the family with you  
on vacation
