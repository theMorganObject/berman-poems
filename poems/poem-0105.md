a Thanksgiving poem

A small country town  
where my cousins lived  
in an old White House  
under a mountain  
with pink lady's slippers  
and jack-in-the-box  
and other wild treasures  
blue-spotted salamanders  
frogs and ribbon snakes  
a stream with trout  
such a joy to visit  
when I was young

The pond in the woods  
all summer would host  
tribes of painted turtles  
and then freeze solid  
in winter ice thick  
enough for a bonfire  
we'd circle around  
gliding on ice skates  
under stars that burned  
in the clear night sky

I remember sleeping there  
up in the attic  
rubbing two fist-sized stones  
of white granite  
and watching the flash  
of orange not quite  
a spark and the smell  
like the caps in my cap gun

And a book I pulled  
from a pile with the title  
that drew me - Adventures  
in the Skin Trade  
I was thinking of sex  
(a hopeful teen-ager)  
but no  
it was stories  
of Wales and witches  
by Dylan Thomas  
a poet I'd yet to discover and  
for whom my grandson is named

Betty and Hal  
left us ages ago  
the old house was sold off  
even before  
like me my cousins  
are grandparents now  
but tonight I'm remembering  
Thanksgiving dinners  
when all of us sat  
at the dining room table  
in Hamden and sang the old hymns  
and delighted in dark meat  
potatoes with gravy  
pecan pie and the talk  
and laughter that ran  
round the table  
with these thoughts  
a sweet mix of gratitude  
and sadness settles  
like a dove  
in the nest of my heart
