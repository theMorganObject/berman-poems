Heading out on our walk  
David says to me Look!  
so I look and way up  
in the branches  
four turkeys are perched

They seem oversized  
for their perches however  
Thanksgiving is only  
a few days away  
so my first thought is  
silly birds  
they must think  
that they'll be safe  
through the holiday  
hiding up there

Then on reflection  
it comes to me  
who but yours truly  
would ever imagine  
that turkeys  
I mean even wild ones  
like these  
could come up with such thoughts
