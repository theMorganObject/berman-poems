The path along the south bank  
of the Rogue  
keeps well above the river  
winds through stands of oak  
vine maple and madrone  
sword fern and bracken  
grace the trail  
on both uphill  
and downhill sides  
it's steep enough  
to keep the dogs from running  
after squirrels or following  
the scent left by a deer

Two miles of gentle trecking  
and you're there  
an eight foot drop  
the river plunging over rocks  
into a swirling pool of frothy white  
at high water the sound  
drowns out your thought  
but it's the salmon leaping  
against the flow  
and falling back to leap  
and leap again  
that makes your memory  
of the scene so vivid
