remembering her wedding in Izmir, June 1994

The church in Izmir  
Episcopal as I recall  
seemed out of place  
in this port city  
with its many mosques  
broadcasting their recorded  
calls to prayer

The church was only ordinary  
but the wedding  
was something special  
with the Turkish guests  
singing to beat the band  
while we Anglos  
on our side of the aisle  
did what we could  
to hold our ground

Ismail's parents  
still very much alive  
were a gracious presence  
hosting my folks  
and me after the wedding  
I still can picture  
the photograph Ismail's father  
showed me  
something deeply personal and touching  
just once he'd gone back to Bulgaria  
to see the town  
where he'd lived with his parents  
as a child  
found no-one who remembered him  
but found a tree  
he recognized from all those years before  
in the photo both his arms are wrapped  
around a limb and his two cheeks  
are wet with tears

Your story, sister dear  
of how the marriage  
came about  
after some years of  
you two circling  
around eachother  
bears telling one more time  
how Ismail flew up  
to spend the Christmas holiday  
with you  
in Moscow where  
you had a job teaching  
in a Soviet era school  
the two of you  
spent a precious week  
and then once more  
Ismail left  
with no plans  
no words about a future  
for your love  
but then a call from Turkey  
Ismail saying  
Susanna let's get married  
oh, and by the way  
I might have to spend  
some time in prison

And you - we'll talk about the marriage  
later - first things first  
let's see about your troubles  
with the law  
and then as luck would have it  
in the courtroom  
the widow of the man  
Ismail had run over  
on a dark road at night  
not knowing what it was  
he'd hit  
said for years I've been expecting  
this to happen  
he was always falling down  
drunk in the street  
the judge threw out the case  
but for the next few months  
Ismail gave up driving  
and you moved in with him  
and planned the wedding

Now it's been over thirty years  
and look  
you two are happy  
settled in your marriage  
with grandkids too  
though not with you in Turkey  
is it possible  
that were it not for him  
that man drunk in the road  
and there's no telling  
how many cars had hit him  
before some witness  
wrote Ismail's licence down  
does it seem possible  
the wedding would have never  
taken place?  
I'm certain you two would have found  
another way  
perhaps another time  
to come together  
still it seems we make God work  
harder than necessary  
to bring our stories  
to their proper endings
