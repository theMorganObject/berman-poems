Despite the warmth and quiet  
here in the house  
dogs sleeping on the rug  
cat on the couch  
as I look out the window  
taking in the cold November sky  
the garden motionless  
as if frozen in time  
the tiny rufus hummer  
swooping in to sip  
every six or seven minutes  
from our feeder on the deck  
I feel the chill of winter  
descending like a lowering sky  
chasing away what still  
remains of that sweet ardor  
aroused by the autumn leaves  
whose passionate golds and crimsons  
lie faded on the soggy ground  
leaving only a sad  
study in brown  
and me to meditate  
on how like seasoned sailors  
we must learn to navigate  
the year's swift turnings  
the long summers and winters  
the too brief springs and falls  
this winter weather I find  
hardest of all

If following my family name  
which bears but little thought  
I could find a hollow  
underground and hibernate  
until the first spring breezes  
awoke me from my dream  
I'd do it in a moment  
leaving this chilly world behind
