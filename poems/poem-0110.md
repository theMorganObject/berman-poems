The family mansion sat  
on a hill not far from Lawrence  
tall white columns rising  
to announce a stately entrance  
I learned that my wife's father  
attorney for the university  
had bought it without taking  
the time to tell his wife  
he seemed not insensitive  
only somewhat quirky  
like his son Tim the doctor  
who one night  
took me for a drive  
to test me I suppose  
going eighty down a country  
road on the wrong side

But what I remember  
most are the fireflies  
thousands of them  
covering the field  
that stretched below the house  
flicking on and off  
in the warm august evening  
like a vast net of  
tiny christmas lights
