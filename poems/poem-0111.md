The task is not to become the anthropologist  
 but the informant  
 Gary Snyder - The Old Ways

White folks called them one-elevens  
the three lines  
looking like the number  
that marked the chins  
of native women  
women of the Klamath tribes  
Yurok, Karuk, Tolowa  
from California  
up the coast  
north to the Arctic  
where the same stripes  
added beauty  
allure, meaning  
to the faces of Inupiat  
Inuit and Yupik women

The tattoos marked the northern stretch  
of the long road  
Alaska south  
to Argentina  
travelled by those first comers  
leaving its traces  
along the way and taken  
to a fine art by the Kayabi  
and other peoples of the Amazon

Almost lost  
and we know  
all too well  
the reason why  
now they're coming back  
these lines applied  
when a girl crosses  
into womanhood  
although today  
the lines have more to do  
with native pride  
with continuity  
and healing

In California  
the ink is made  
from alder burned  
to sooty black  
the stripes  
appear dark blue  
just recently  
I saw a woman  
wearing them  
she seemed completely  
unselfconscious  
in a local restaurant  
a tribute to the tribal  
world's resilience  
and the good work  
of bringing back  
what still can be  
retrieved from all that's lost  
those precious gifts  
the ancestors passed down  
and that we each  
whatever tribe we claim  
must try  
as best we can  
to bring to light  
to share with others  
and to own ourselves
