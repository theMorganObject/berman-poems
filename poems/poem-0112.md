for Dennis Freese

Onstage together  
that season for Othello  
you with the e-flat  
clarinet you'd painted brown  
to look more folksy  
and you made it sound  
just as exotic  
and as turkish as my oud  
we were a team  
or a duo at least  
makeup and costume  
to fit the roles for which  
they'd hired us  
with the cast  
putting on a superb show  
every night  
a sellout audience  
ovations calling  
the actors back to bow  
multiple times

Our mournful tune  
before the action started  
set the stage  
for what was coming  
all to soon  
even today  
and knowing it's a fiction  
the dark tragedy  
of those three lives  
still haunts me  
Desdemona innocent  
victim of Iago's artifice  
Othello trapped in  
murderous jealosy and pride  
a web of lies  
that caught all three  
as a spider catches flies

And through it all  
your friendship was the thing  
that meant the most  
more than the thrill  
of the performance  
though it was thrilling  
being part of something  
so alive  
both in the language  
and the acting  
still if not  
for you I would have felt alone  
even adrift among that  
glamorous crew  
who seemed so focused  
so much in their element

It's been a dozen years or more  
we're still good friends  
though we no longer  
work together  
sharing musical delights  
it would take finding  
a new repertoire  
like those Brazilian choros  
we recorded  
tunes that fit our instruments  
and sensibilities so well

With fingers grown  
too stiff I've moved away  
from the guitar  
but treasure all the more  
the times and melodies  
that we once played  
and in a safer world  
when this pandemic's passed  
perhaps we'll once again  
join forces  
to make music  
that delights our senses  
maybe even moves an audience  
though it's unlikely that  
we'll dress in costume  
hold the stage  
as we did  
for Othello
