for Susanna

How young we were then  
you only eleven  
what were our parents thinking  
sending you off to classes  
in a language you had no way  
of understanding  
but still you had a friend  
Tanya and now  
after some sixty years  
you send me a photo  
the two of you smiling  
and a reminiscence from that time  
read aloud on youtube  
telling of the love  
you two girls shared  
both orphaned in a way  
she with no father  
and an alcoholic mother  
living in a poor apartment  
you with what our father  
would call every opportunity  
yet somehow feeling unseen  
as I did also  
in our family  
so you remember the dark stairway  
up to Tanya's apartment  
and the communal soup  
cooking in the corridor  
and the piano in the corner  
and the heartfelt reality  
of Tanya's love
