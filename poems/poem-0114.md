In his classes  
it would seem  
nothing was happening  
then all at once  
lightning would flash  
and you would think  
so that's how  
the minds works  
that's what this word  
is trying hard to tell us  
then he'd smile  
and seem amused  
like a magician  
showing a child a trick

He was such a gentleman  
with him you never  
felt talked down to  
when I told him  
I was leaving after all those years  
he shared with me his own  
desire to leave  
while a young man  
but it was during the Depression  
and by then  
he had a wife and child  
and so he chose  
to stick it out  
it was a kindness  
that response  
when I was feeling  
that I was letting  
all my teachers down  
dashing my father's  
hopes for his oldest son

Of Boodberg's history  
I knew but little  
seems his family  
had fled the Bolsheviks  
his parents coming  
from aristocratic stock  
were at risk  
they made their way  
to San Francisco  
back in nineteen-twenty  
when he was seventeen  
and already  
something of a language prodigy

One story from his undergraduate days  
asked on an application  
to name race and religion  
he'd written "mixed"  
and "animism"  
this would not do  
the dean had called him in  
for explanation  
and he'd said that having taken  
first-year anthropology he knew  
there's no such thing  
as a pure race  
and that when the faith  
of ones forefathers no longer serves  
what's left is animism  
one can only think  
he left the dean non-plussed!

One time  
knowing I was drawn  
to buddhist practice  
he wrote out for me  
this little tribute  
to the Middle Way

For, unto and within  
the billion bions  
the blessed Buddha's bell  
booms, bings, bongs  
billows and becalms

Why bings?  
because, he chuckled,  
the Buddha also has  
a sense of humor  
as did this genial  
scholar, multi-linguist  
my guide to classical Chinese  
and to the secret  
life of words  
during those years of war  
in Vietnam and strife at home  
so it's his half-quizzical  
half-laughing smile  
that comes to mind  
each time I think of him  
and take a moment to reflect  
on just how blessed  
my life has been  
for knowing such a man
