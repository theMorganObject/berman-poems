It was the spring before I moved  
to be with you  
before we married  
you flew out to see me  
in Jerusalem  
I was touched  
excited so I found us  
an apartment  
we rented a car and drove  
up north to Tzvat  
where we shared a shabbos dinner  
with a family you knew  
the husband sang Eshes Khayil  
a woman of valor  
and we went shopping  
in the outdoor market  
I bought a shofar  
still smelling of goat  
and together  
we looked at what  
the local artists had for sale

We picked out something  
by a woman from south africa  
who worked in soft pastels  
with colored pencils  
a gentle fantasy with  
three young men  
up on a rooftop dancing  
their hands uplifted  
their eyes closed  
as if in trance  
faces serene  
they seem like buddhist monks  
rather than hasids

The colors are unnatural  
but soothing  
pink watermelon hills  
behind the houses  
the whole work speaks  
a gentle whimsy  
almost carefree  
something I'd hardly seen  
in Jewish art  
except of course Chagall  
but this had lightness  
not the intensity of Chagall's vision  
you let me keep it when we  
parted company  
now it brings to mind  
the playful spirit  
the sense of whimsy that  
you bring to your own art
