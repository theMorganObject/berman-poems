for my grandchildren

Before you were born  
your parents had a house  
on 12th Street in Los Osos  
the first house they owned  
built on a narrow lot  
like a boat  
with levels to make up  
for what it lacked  
in horizontal space  
I thought it a small marvel  
of ingenuity

While they were still living there  
I met the man who'd designed  
and built it for his graduate  
degree in architecture  
at Cal Poly  
the same school that brought  
your parents to Los Osos

This chance encounter happened  
in a small town  
on the coast  
of Oregon where he  
and his wife had a home  
that looked out  
on the ocean

A friend of my friend Les  
who'd invited our guitar trio  
to perform for the local  
concert series  
Les had asked this fellow  
guitar enthusiast  
was hosting our trio  
to host us overnight  
after our concert

How we stumbled on the fact  
of the Los Osos connection
