Numbers don't lie  
though those who use them do  
not always  
but often enough  
and yet it's comforting  
when the numbers are on your side  
when the odds favor your choice  
of candidate  
or predict a winning season  
for your team

To know the world  
you need a few statistics  
and yet  
what are the odds  
of being born  
to these particular parents  
or for that matter  
of being born at all?  
then there are those  
seemingly chance encounters  
that change your life  
and are at once impossible  
and yet inevitable  
too charged with meaning to be  
just coincidence

True everything is happening  
co-incidently  
but it's not just coincidence  
if you can see  
beneath the surface  
feel your way down  
to where life's hidden roots  
reach out in all directions  
subtly connect us  
to the stars  
the mountains  
to everything alive  
and doing so  
create a ground for words  
of healing  
acts of kindness  
rooted in that wisdom  
that deep sense  
of kinship  
with whomever or whatever  
by coincidence  
happens to cross your path
