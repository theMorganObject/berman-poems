We get as far in our spiritual life  
 as we get in our relationship  
 with our mother - Dharma Master Hua

The hitchhiker made me think  
of a leprechaun  
something in the eyes  
the way he smiled  
as we picked him up and again  
as we let him off  
leaving he thanked us  
dipping casually into a small  
bag of clear plastic  
full of what looked  
like white sugar  
and handed us  
me and my brother John  
about a teaspoon each  
pure mescaline he told us  
and it being nineteen-seventy  
and we still in our twenties  
believed him  
thought let's try it  
this may be our only chance

Later on  
while I was floating free  
of any sense of self  
I spent an hour among  
my family and saw  
my parents  
grandparents  
my aunts and uncles  
as a clan of silverbacks  
amazing animals  
but are they safe  
living like this  
out in the wild?  
perhaps a zoo  
would be a better option

Then my mother took me  
on a visit  
an older couple  
she was helping  
they were staying  
in a poorly furnished trailer  
on the wall  
a cheap print  
showed a viking ship  
its bright sail set  
against a dark and threatening ocean  
my mother stood beside it  
in that moment  
I knew the source  
of her broad shoulders  
stoic stance  
the force  
behind her eyes  
as if she'd gazed  
on North Atlantic swells  
for generations

I thought  
this woman was my passage  
into a human life  
possibly the only life  
I'll ever have  
to honor her is just  
the least that I can do  
if I am to become  
fully human at last  
nothing profound about this  
yet I'd never before  
felt the truth of this so deeply  
just another moment  
passing quickly  
changing everything
