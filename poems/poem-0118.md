No Indians  
only my grandfather  
reciting the poem that honored  
his colonial forebears  
From Somerset and Devon  
he would intone  
from Kent and Lincolnshire  
only much later  
would I come to understand  
his misplaced pride  
and why it was the younger sons  
who "came forward"  
having been disinherited  
both by custom and by law  
so as to preserve the great estates  
which goes a long way  
towards explaining  
the British Empire

But it was moving  
to me as a boy  
hearing his resonant voice  
reach out over the wooded hillside  
though regardless the name  
of the hill we stood on  
the poem never mentioned  
the smallpox epidemic  
that had opened so to speak  
the coastal land for settlement  
even before the Mayflower  
sailed into Cape Cod bay  
the plague  
a clear sign of God's purpose

Today the Wampanoags  
whose ancestors arrived  
toward the end of the last ice age  
have restored the native name  
Aquinnah rather than Gay Head  
and I suspect Tashtego  
Melville's Gay Head harpooner  
would be happy with the change

The Maori are said  
to have turned down the official  
offer of two billion dollars  
saying no thanks we're waiting  
to have our island back

Sadly with Martha's Vineyard  
the only one to take the island back  
will be the sea itself  
rising as the polar ice  
keeps melting and the ocean  
keeps expanding with the heat

Before that happens though  
there's time enough to taste the sweetness  
of the native grapes  
to wade in tidal ponds left  
by the ice in its retreat  
time to watch the sunset  
from Menemsha as the spring tide  
rushes in to fill the great pond  
and the sun sinks  
into Vineyard Sound  
while in the east  
the full moon rises  
huge on the horizon

There's time as well to honor  
if belatedly  
the first migrants to settle here  
millennia before  
the European colonists arrived  
who left ceremonial spear points  
pale yellow and blue flints  
beautifully knapped  
long buried under Vineyard sand  
and whose Wampanoag descendants  
still dig for quahogs  
gather wild cranberries  
for the mid-October festival  
still tell their children the old tales  
and work the red and yellow clays  
of the Aquinnah cliffs
