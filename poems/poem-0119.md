A small town  
and quiet in the  
slack winter season  
one general store  
a gas station  
a few rows of vacatiion homes  
cabins mostly  
nothing fancy  
but lovely in the snow  
with long icicles that dripped  
in the bright December sun  
and in the night with stars  
a half dozen carolers  
singing their way  
along the street  
past the house we'd rented  
to spend Christmas  
with brothers, sisters  
sons, daughters and inlaws  
who love doing picture puzzles  
silly presents  
wine and cider  
a flurry in the kitchen  
leading up to dinnertime

Then in the morning  
off to hike Mount Lassen  
on cross-country skis  
up the slope of the volcano  
quiet now but only  
a hundred years ago  
smoke and ash that rose  
over thirty thousand feet

Our hike ended at a pool  
of bubbling sulfur water  
a pungent reminder  
of the planet's inner heat  
and a chance for us to take off  
our mittens, warm our fingers  
before gliding back  
down the slope on our skis

This year with the virus  
the numbers rising steadily  
we'll be holing up at home  
trying to keep safe  
for our own sake and for others  
it makes it all the sweeter  
to think back just a year ago  
how the family gathered  
in Mineral California  
and spent the days of Christmas  
delighting in the company  
and treasuring the quiet  
of the mountain and the snow
