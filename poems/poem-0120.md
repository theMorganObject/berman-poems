Is this the planet  
on a mission to  
defend itself  
or Is it karma  
consequence  
of the cruel trade  
in monkeys  
marmosets  
exotic birds  
does global warming  
play a part and  
will the vaccine  
teach us to live with this  
as we have learned  
to live with winter flu  
how long before  
the next one comes around  
will we have learned  
to be better prepared

So many questions  
so few answers  
all we know  
is that we haven't reached the end  
or yet had time  
to take account  
of all the losses suffered  
especially by the poor  
the elderly  
those whose health  
already compromised  
puts them at greater risk

Doctors, nurses, physician's aids  
work overtime to help  
the sick, the dying  
and the hospitals  
are running out of beds  
while I a bystander  
retired from active duty  
hole up here  
at home  
writing this useless verse
