This year it's just the two of us  
Carroll and I  
unless you count  
two poodles  
and a Maine coon cat

Just we two  
to light the candles  
say the blessings  
sing the songs and  
gaze into the flames

But now the room  
begins to fill with some  
still in this world  
some graduated to the next  
dear ones with whom  
we lit and blessed and sang  
at this same time  
in other years and places

My teacher taught  
it wasn't that the oil  
lasted eight days  
the miracle  
was that they could find any oil at all  
after the Temple had been razed and sacked

Just so  
tonight the miracle  
is to be here at all  
sharing this moment  
the two of us  
but also with our loved ones  
present in the room  
familiar faces  
voices  
these simple candles have evoked
