What to say? You should have had  
another score  
at very least  
of years and music making  
my genial friend  
it's hard to find the words  
to tell how much we miss you  
miss your kindness  
humor and deep intelligence  
that brought so many of us  
into the warm circle of your love  
lover of horses, people  
women in particular  
but also in particular Vivaldi  
Bach and Telemann  
all things baroque  
recorders, oboes  
archlutes, harpsichords

I remember how we two  
drove to Seattle  
to requisition parts for a French instrument  
a harpsichord you wanted me to build  
and how we laughed  
the whole way up the interstate  
for me more laughter in one day  
than in the entire year  
prior to our trip

You made yourself a home  
out of a barn  
and lived completely  
off the grid  
on 12 volt solar  
with an outdoor shitter  
in the back  
and horses that you rode  
and bred for colts  
the house half taken up  
with a hand-bellowed forge  
with which you made  
not only horse gear  
but exquisite music stands  
fireplace tongs and pokers  
kitchen spatulas  
such as the one you made  
for me and Carroll  
putting your own and our  
initials on the blade

On your bookshelves  
along with printed music  
Patrick O'brian's twenty volume set  
of sea yarns and the diary of Samuel Pepys  
unlikely there are many English readers  
besides yourself who've worked  
their way through that detailed account  
of London life back in the sixteen hundreds

Of your creations  
I think you'd agree  
that the most splendid  
was the orchestra  
you founded and directed  
the Jefferson Baroque  
with its performances  
of period music played  
on period instruments  
you on recorder, oboe  
and your voice  
beautifully resonant  
suited both for the music  
and to engage the audience  
with welcoming remarks  
that drew the listeners  
into that space  
where they could take in fully  
what the evening offered

there's so much I could say  
so much to thank you for  
but bringing us together  
myself and Carroll  
whom you too had loved  
and who'd loved you  
for me this is the gift  
for which no words of thanks  
gestures of gratitude  
could ever be sufficient

So you live on  
sealed in the hearts  
of those who've loved you  
including we musicians of your orchestra  
remembering the music that your brought  
into our lives  
which still plays on in memory  
I think of you and start to hear the voices  
of boxwood flute, baroque oboe  
and flauto dolce  
singing sweetly over figured bass  
I know no better form of immortality
