Through folds of hills  
green peaks that pierce the sky  
I drift and dream  
and lose track of the years

On paths that ramble  
over rippling streams  
my footsteps guide me  
past all human cares

The world of human striving  
a dim memory  
hidden behind the screen  
of cloud and mist

My mind is emptied now  
of all desires  
my heart a dry leaf  
shaking in the breeze

Should I return  
to Chang-an in the fall  
before the mountain  
turns to ice and snow

I'll see that gaudy world  
a mere illusion  
this higher world  
all that I need to know
