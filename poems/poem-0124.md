Even as the oil diminished  
yet held through those uncertain days  
the oil lamps burning  
cast long shadows  
that danced and flickered  
on the stones  
restoring what the ruined temple  
needed more than rebuilt walls  
there at the center  
gentle light  
and steady flame  
to touch the soul  
speaking God's presence  
human yearning  
human hopes and human loves

So we latecomers  
light the candles  
adding one more  
every night  
enact the human miracle  
seeking more light  
ever more light

As I watch the candles gutter  
there's a fading orange glow  
reflected in the window and  
evoking fires of long ago  
fires that like the temple lamps  
spoke sacred life to human hearts  
light to guide us, guard us,  
warm our hearts  
and bless our days
