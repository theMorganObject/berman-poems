These farming folk  
descendents of the immigrants  
who were the first to plough  
the prairie earth  
who taking for themselves the native name  
sent the Kansa packing to Oklahoma  
these more recent dwellers  
on the land  
patriots, believers in America  
voted nine out of ten  
for the homegrown Mussolini  
who's mascaraded as our president  
these past four years  
and having followed his example  
and rejected masks  
as an affront  
to their God-granted freedom  
they've now lost parents  
grandparents and elders  
bedrock of the community  
and are in mourning for their loss

I suppose these rural Kansans  
thought their isolation  
would protect them  
from the Covid as it had  
from the madness  
of the coastal cities  
where lesbian and gay are seen  
as something normal  
where Democrats conspire  
to turn the country  
into a Marxist factory

Sad losses  
sad to have been so mislead  
by TV adds and by a government  
already so mistrusted  
and by politicians  
who care more for their jobs  
than for truth or our democracy

Now that this plague is killing  
some American on average  
every forty seconds  
we will see  
if the science that's been so maligned  
these past few years  
though not by doctors  
or health professionals  
can with their help  
begin to turn the tide
