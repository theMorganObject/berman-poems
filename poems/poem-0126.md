A massless particle  
the dictionary said  
when I first looked it up  
back in the '60s  
so wonderfully small  
they pass right through  
our bodies  
through the entire planet  
as if nothing were there  
in fact if all the space  
between us and Alpha Centauri  
our nearest neighboring star  
twenty-five trillion miles away  
were filled with water  
a neutrino travelling through  
would see only a single  
water molecule

Then clever scientists  
proved there's a tiny mass  
less than a millionth  
the mass of an electron  
yet tiny as they are  
there are so many  
their mass is more  
than all else put together

They come from the Big Bang  
from super novae  
from stars such as our sun  
from nuclear reactors  
the sun bombards us  
every second sending tens of billions  
through every centimeter  
of our planet's sunward surface

From Wikipedia I learn  
neutrinos have no size  
no width, no volume  
but have counterparts  
anti-neutrinos spinning  
in the opposite direction  
and that they come  
in what the physicists call flavors  
each with a slightly different mass  
and oscillating change  
from one flavor to another  
as if a cat could change  
into a leopard and then back  
moving at speeds so close  
to the speed of light  
the difference is undetectable

All this suggests to my  
non-scientific mind  
that this universe  
is bent on teasing us  
still holding back its secrets  
like a lover coyly beckoning  
or like a loving parent  
encouraging a child to walk  
by backing off a bit  
while gesturing and smiling  
to urge the toddler on
