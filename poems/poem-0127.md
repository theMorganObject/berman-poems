Nine candles in the window  
the antique clock chimes ten  
I hear it's quiet ticking and  
cars passing in the rain  
the house has grown so quiet  
my tinnitus seems loud  
the candles are beginning  
to burn down and gutter out  
remembering my rabbis  
Aryeh and Jonathan  
I feel a surge of sadness  
for all that might have been  
the wicks have turned to glowing coals  
the final candle flares  
now I can join my wife in bed  
and put aside my cares
