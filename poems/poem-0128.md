Today my son turned forty-six  
a number  
whose meaning is beyond  
my powers of computation  
we spoke briefly on the phone  
he was at work  
but took the time to share  
a few reflections  
there was a sweetness  
in his voice, a quality  
of listening that touched me  
once again  
one of his many gifts  
is his ability  
to listen thoughtfully  
without intruding  
a skill I've never learned  
despite my years

Of all the ways my life  
has brought me joy  
and blessings beyond  
any I'd imagined  
myself worthy of  
this lovely man  
good husband, father  
best of sons  
has blessed me  
with the most  
precious of gifts  
a father could hope for  
today my cup is spilling over  
with the sweetest wine I know
