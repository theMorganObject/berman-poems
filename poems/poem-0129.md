It was the pale translucence  
of the jelly in the glass  
when grandmother had set it  
in the window where the sun  
made the warm colors glow  
as if with their own light  
that must have struck me  
as a child  
since that almost ethereal  
light and color  
still come through clear  
nearly eight decades later

I remember how she took me  
to pick quinces  
just the two of us  
that time when I was  
all of four or five  
we walked together  
down the gravel drive  
or was it dirt?  
below the house  
and out along the paved road  
possibly a hundred yards  
to where she'd found  
a quince bush growing  
small but well endowed with fruit  
which we two picked

All this came back to mind  
seeing the quince tree  
by the fence that runs  
along the parking lot  
where I had stopped  
to meet a friend  
a tree with fruit still hanging  
like bedraggled Christas ornaments  
on the upper branches  
out of reach

Coming back with our long handled picker  
I harvested a dozen or so quinces  
a sad looking lot  
after the frost  
and rainy weather  
but they cleaned up nicely  
and while cooking  
filled the house with  
a sweet fragrance  
it made nearly a quart  
not quite as pale as grandma's  
but clear and warm  
the color of the strands  
of amber beads she liked to wear

I've set the jars aside  
and once the jelly's cooled  
we'll find out if the flavor  
is a match for the sweet fragrance  
that my wife and I enjoyed  
but no matter how delicious  
it will never match  
my memory of the grandmother I loved  
nor that first taste of sugared quince  
spooned from a jar  
in grandma's country kitchen
