And lazy as a sleepy hand
that scarcely moves on the clock's face
the day drags on for centuries
holding us fast in its embrace
B. Pasternak - 1960

Was he was confused
and thinking of the vernal equinox
why else the melting icicles, the puddles
the nesting boxes steaming in the heat
and lazy lovers strolling arm-in-arm
hardly a December scene
and yet he clearly wrote
of the sun's mid-winter turning
here in Oregon the winter weather
also varies year to year and differs
east to west from Idaho
to the Pacific coast
today Grants Pass is overcast
but hardly freezing
it's good to know
the days will start to lengthen
and spring creep up on us
even before we're ready
to let the winter go
