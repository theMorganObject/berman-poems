para mi hermano  
 Juan Bermudez

With my brother I walked out  
along the jetty  
the far side of the river  
barely visible  
vendors had set up stalls  
and men were gambling  
throwing dice  
down on the hard packed dirt  
one had a red-tailed boa  
that he kept close at hand  
pulling it back before  
it crawled beyond his reach

The sun was setting  
the air was wet and salty  
there were little crabs decked out  
in the bright colors of the tropics  
small waves slapped against the jetty  
on the one side  
while on the other  
the slow moving Magdalena  
seemed nearly another ocean

It's been forty years  
but in my mind  
I still can taste  
the salt air  
feel the heaviness  
of evening closing in  
witness the sun's  
red-orange disk  
as it sinks slowly  
through the haze  
into the darkling sea
