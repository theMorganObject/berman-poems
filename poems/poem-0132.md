Just as some families  
some friendships  
even marriages  
attenuate and those who once were close  
become like distant planets  
through no fault  
or intention of their own  
so as the universe expands  
the galaxies recede  
moving apart from one another  
with ever greater speed

It's not the galaxies  
themselves accelerating  
but the space between them  
that expands  
until the speed at which  
the great star systems  
move apart  
exceeds even the speed of light  
then they become like couples  
who have grown so distant  
they can no longer talk  
to one another  
this is the future  
of our universe  
that the astrophysicists predict

How good to live now  
in this present universe  
where Andromeda is still in view  
and the Hubble telescope amazes  
with images of fiery pinwheels, spirals  
star clusters, nebulae and quasars  
so distant that their light  
has been streaming towards us from almost  
the moment time began  
and what a blessing to be conjoined  
with the one  
who comes to find me  
regardless where I hide  
whose light illuminates  
my moon's dark side  
she the fixed star  
whose gravitation keeps me  
in orbit lest I float off into space  
her love the stellar force  
the field that holds me  
within the bounds of love's  
cosmic embrace
