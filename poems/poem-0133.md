Renzo Lazzarini  
our dear friend  
has remembered us again  
sending news of his family  
in good health  
despite the virus  
raging through the country  
same as here  
keeping them and us  
cooped up like pigeons  
in our homes

I remember how we met  
we'd come by bus  
my wife and I  
from nearby Lucca  
to the little town  
of San Lorenzo  
where her grandfather  
was born  
grew up and lived  
before he came  
an immigrant  
to San Francisco

The bus failed to return  
no taxi service  
but nearby  
a man was wheeling  
a glass jug  
so big it filled his wheelbarrow  
Carroll asked him where  
he planned to take it and  
we started chatting  
soon we were invited in  
to meet his wife Nicoletta  
look through the family photos  
hear about the Califonia cousins  
then he drove us home to our hotel  
in Lucca

That was six years ago  
we've been back once  
to stay with them  
spent time with Davide  
their son and his gay husband  
met their daughter  
daughter's children  
stayed in touch through email  
all this thanks to Carroll's interest  
in family roots  
leading in turn to my romance  
with the Italian tongue  
la bella lingua

A paragon of generosity  
Renzo has driven us  
all through the Tuscan countryside  
to see the sights  
the Devil's Bridge he worked on  
as an engineer  
to mountain villages  
churches and caves  
the quarry from which  
Michaelangelo obtained his marble

Tonight I'm wishing him  
and Nicoletta  
all the Lazzarini family  
a joyous Christmas  
same as they wish us

May La Befana  
the good witch who visits children  
through the days of Christmas  
bringing gifts  
bring joy and pleasure  
to the grandchildren  
Renzo and Nicoletta hold so dear

And may the light of Christmas  
usher in a year  
of hope and promise  
fill the hearts  
of our Italian friends  
with all the blessings  
flowing from the birth  
in Bethlehem
