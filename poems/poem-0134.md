Christmas stockings  
to be filled with children's toys  
and candy canes  
things calculated  
to delight a child  
but for me my newly  
self-appointed sisters  
chose a pair of socks  
folded in gift paper  
and tucked inside a box  
with ribbon tied around  
the shiny silver wrapping

They brought it to me  
from beneath their artificial tree  
aglow with strings of colored lights  
not quite the same as I remember  
when we'd bring in a living tree  
and let the pungent scent of fir  
fill all the house  
with the fragrance of Christmas

These were no ordinary socks  
they sported notes of music  
set into a staff  
with f sharp placed  
where it belongs  
on the top line  
the whole effect  
so whimsical it set us all  
to laughing  
and my feet to dancing  
as if on their own  
across the room

My wife took photos  
we moved on  
to opening other presents  
sipping wine and munching  
crackers with soft cheese  
and sharing family stories  
but the feeling of these socks  
so smooth against my skin  
and my feet in them moving  
playfully around the room  
delighting in their whimsical design  
that is the Christmas gift  
I most remember
