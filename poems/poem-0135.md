The day came wet and cold  
the bedclothes seemed a safe retreat  
until mid-morning  
when the urge to pee  
became too strong for even  
this most stubborn of  
procrastinators

At noon our Dawn arrived  
from Richmond  
with her pitbull Oakley  
and our poodles were  
as glad to see their canine friend  
as we to welcome in  
this lovely daughter

A lazy afternoon  
a little houswork  
kitchen stuff  
some reading  
and a facetime conversation  
with Dawn's sister  
back in West Virginia  
laughter like little bells  
at both ends  
of the line  
as sisters traded  
family news  
warm smiles  
and Christmas wishes

For some it marks  
a deep felt miracle  
but all of us  
from Apaches to Zulus  
count the years  
from that mythic event  
the birth in Bethlehem

This year the day brought memories  
that stretch back far  
as any I can summon  
family scenes  
grandfather reading  
from the Bible  
father playing  
his accordion  
while we sang the old carols  
mother heating mulled wine  
on the stove and serving  
cookies frosted pink and green  
a guardian angel set high  
on the tree we'd wrapped  
with strings of silver  
hung with balls of red  
and blue and gold  
piled presents underneath  
my parents, uncles, aunts, grandparents  
all of them gone so long ago  
it seems a distant dream

And still there's something  
beyond words  
something ineffable the lights  
the songs, the greeting cards  
betoken and yet none  
can ever quite express

Something the word eternal  
struggles to evoke  
and still the mystery  
is here with us  
hidden before our eyes  
if we could only open them

It's with us every day  
but somehow with the lights  
the tree, the caroling  
we're able to come closer  
now at Christmas
