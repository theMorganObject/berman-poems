It's said  
but do they really know?  
that all of us belonging  
to the male persuasion  
get this cancer  
if we're lucky  
live to what's been called  
a ripe old age

Not sure if that's a comfort  
but the doctors say the odds  
that I will die of something else  
are roughly nine to one  
and I do find that  
rather reassuring

These odds are predicated  
on my undergoing treatment  
radiation - no big deal  
as it turned out  
but next what my urologist  
called chemical castration

I said there must be  
some less gruesome term  
he smiled and nodded  
told me it was  
only for two years  
and jotted down the  
requisite prescription

The Lupron put me through my paces  
two years last November  
now we wait to see  
whether my energy returns  
and if the numbers tracking  
cancer start to climb

Like all disease  
it's been an opportunity  
to learn  
an education on so many  
levels that my impulse  
is to give the cancer  
more credit than due

But really it's been just another  
part of aging  
just another exercise  
in letting go  
and getting ready  
for the final leap  
I hope will be  
truly a leap of faith
