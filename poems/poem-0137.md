At the end of the summer  
after we'd cabled in the root wads  
some of them fifteen feet across  
restoring habitat lost after the flood  
of nineteen sixty-four  
when the creek filled with debris  
thanks to the logging  
and the bulldozers came through  
leaving no shelter for the salmon  
the steelhead, cuthroat trout  
the reward for our work was coming back  
in time to see two steelhead trout  
eight or ten pounders  
using their powerful tails  
to make a redd  
to hold the precious eggs  
safe in the gravel bed  
our root wads now protected
