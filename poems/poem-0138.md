There on my office wall  
above Waterman's map  
of the village that the Yurok  
called Tsurai  
with native names  
for all the rocks  
the seastacks in the bay  
I've hung the framed artwork  
of my friend Dorothy

It is a playful piece  
botanically accurate  
but whimsical as well  
the understated colors  
blues and greys and yellows  
seem natural, the label  
identifies the subject  
as twin zea mays  
two ears of indian corn

A pair of birds in flight  
these whispy ears of corn  
one chasing close behind  
the other through a plain white sky  
their bodies, beaks and wings  
the cobs, the husks and tassels  
so different from the corn we know  
these small ancestral plants  
with kernels sitting in the cobs  
like rows of tiny teeth

What was behind the drawing?  
perhaps the indian corn  
reflected in some way  
her work with native children  
this teacher who believed in bringing  
art and dance and drama  
into the classroom and the lives  
of the less privileged  
hoping to give them something real  
to nourish pride  
self worth and creativity

She left us far too soon  
only months after our last  
walk in the Arizona sun  
along a dry arroyo  
east of Tucson  
now I feel her presence  
in these twin ears of corn  
playful and serious at once  
chasing eachother through  
a different sky, another world  
beyond this one
