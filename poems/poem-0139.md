How do they survive  
these freezing winter nights  
these little packages of fluff and feather?  
by the day's first light  
they're back at the bird feeder  
taking turns snatching a seed  
flicking their tails

Warblers, house finches, chickadees  
pine siskins, junkos, sparrows  
their names nearly as pleasurable  
as they are to watch  
they flit about more quickly  
than the human eye can follow  
showing us what it means  
to be alive
