It was a cartoon  
I think in the New Yorker  
a novice monk sitting in meditation  
next to an older monk  
both cross-legged  
on their mats  
the young monk asking  
so what happens next?

And that's my question too  
after the dancers  
have left the room  
the music faded  
to an old fashioned waltz  
after you've settled down  
into your life  
your marriage  
and the words  
that once whirled madly  
inside your head have settled  
in the way that sediment  
stirred up by shaking  
and then left in peace  
sinks to the bottom of the water glass  
so you are left transparent  
clear of past ambitions and desires  
what's next?  
the old monk had the answer  
I still struggle with  
nothing  
he said  
you're there  
nothing is next
