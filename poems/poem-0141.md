Outside the kitchen window  
the yard's awash in sunlight  
warblers and finches crowd the bird feeder  
quick to arrive and quickly on their way  
they know only the present day and moment  
we who have filled the feeder  
have longer thoughts to think  
but are we more alive  
our lives more precious?  
to ourselves certainly  
but otherwise?  
perhaps that's not the question  
to be asking  
this last day of the year  
when on the holly  
the crimson berries  
poke out through the leaves  
like jasper beads the sun  
has set aglow
