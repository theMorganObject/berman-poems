Watching our poodle  
with his white shaggy  
sheepswool coat  
no fancy cut for him  
finding the perfect spot to land  
on our blood-red turkish carpet

He takes his time  
circling around once  
then twice before he's finally  
ready to settle down  
what is this circling  
I ask myself  
do his wild cousins  
his wolf ancestors  
do the same?

Dropping down soundlessly  
graceful for all his advanced years  
he curls into a ball and is asleep  
in what seems no time at all  
what I wouldn't give  
for that grace  
that trust  
that innocence
