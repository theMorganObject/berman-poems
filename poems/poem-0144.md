A postcard from Cambodia  
from the museum in Phnom-Penh  
sits on my windowsill  
a statue's smiling face  
Lord Krishna looking more human  
than godlike though his features  
seem possibly too perfect  
too symmetrical  
no writing on the back  
I must have bought it somewhere  
though I have no memory of doing so  
only now I learn the story  
of Krishna Govardhana  
how the young Krishna protected  
the farming folk from Indra's wrath  
sheltering them from stormy winds  
and flooding rains  
by lifting on his little finger  
the entire Govard mountain  
holding it over them  
like an umbrella  
until Indra at last relented  
no wonder so many millions  
revere this divine being  
who is there among us now  
with such power and such love  
able to protect the poor  
the tens of millions struggling  
to scratch a living from the land  
whose lives and livlihoods  
are always under threat  
from flooding rains  
from droughts and hurricanes  
from the violence of wars  
from plagues like this one  
that we're living through  
sweet Lord Krishna how  
the world could benefit  
from your strength  
your smiling presence  
your benevolence!
