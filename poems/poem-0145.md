Today again I heard the word fascism  
someone on the radio in Atlanta  
talking election politics  
and also something bigger  
fascism  
not a word to throw around  
lightly and I thought  
that's good  
some have begun to call  
a spade a spade  
because as Walter Benjamin  
noted back before the Second War  
when the boundaries between  
corporate capital and government  
dissolve or stretch so thin  
they seem invisible  
fascism is the proper name  
for what you have  
and so this race in Georgia  
may help decide our country's path  
from here on out

Recalling that both Hitler  
and Moussolini came to power  
winning the majority vote  
it seems if our democracy  
is nothing more than free elections  
the likely winners those  
able to raise the most campaign funds  
from corporate contributers  
and billionaires with superpacs  
while feeding people's fears  
stoking their anger and false pride  
with false promises and lies  
then the American experiment is over

Tomorrow we'll know more  
although it's just another step  
either furthering our home-grown  
brand of fascism  
or affirming the republic that Republicans  
used to believe in  
a bit ironic  
that the outcome likely lies  
with the decendants of Africans  
brought here in chains

Why what I'm saying is so contrary  
to what half the populace  
considers true  
is an important question  
one awaiting further answers  
and of course there's  
the unacknowledged elephant  
this time not sitting in the room  
but already on the move  
I'm thinking of the climate refugees  
by some counts over half a billion  
by mid-century  
no wonder that the world is looking  
toward authoritarian leaders  
strong men to build the walls  
they hope will keep  
those aliens our less fortunate  
brothers and sisters out

This fantasy of self-sufficient isolation  
will only serve to make  
within our walls  
domestic prisoners of us all  
The poet Auden said it long ago  
in the end there's only  
this one choice  
we must discredit what he called  
the lie of authority  
we must love one another  
or we die
