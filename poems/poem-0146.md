Caught in the act of reaching  
to turn over her tortillas  
heating on the little woodfired stove  
this nearly faceless woman  
mexican or guatemalan  
stands in her kitchen  
with a simple strength and grace  
not young not beautiful  
but easy to imagine her  
having once been  
both those things

Her head is covered with  
a dark green kerchief  
matching the color of her dress  
behind her back her apron  
is tied with a pale blue bow  
her face an olive brown  
eyes intent and lips  
pursed in concentration  
while the coals in the brazier  
burn with a red and orange glow  
suggest a hearth that centers  
the whole scene

Shadows in the background  
play in a darkened dining room  
where the outlines of a table  
and chair are faintly visible  
the blurriness offsets  
the clear and vivid foreground  
and gives the painting both  
contrast and depth

The whole conveys respect  
for what Burns called honest poverty  
and for the skill of those who make  
food from the local earth  
here in our home she holds  
a place up on the landing wall  
reminding us of something precious  
yet not easy to pin down  
something about the land  
and those who dwell as part of it  
something about integrity and  
the artist's seeing eye
