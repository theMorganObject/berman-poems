Outside my window traces  
of the falling rain  
the trees dark green and still against  
the pale grey sky  
the garden dormant  
hungry birds  
collecting at the feeder  
while we stay home  
respect the spreading death  
a year of global plague  
that should unite us  
people everywhere against  
a common enemy  
and yet there's news  
of wars, of violence  
old habits we still haven't  
learned to shed  
the rain is coming harder now  
pelting the roofs of houses  
up and down the street  
the ground welcomes the rain  
keeping it safely  
stored for the still distant spring
