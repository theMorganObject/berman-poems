What else was I to do?  
ignore the High Priest Kaifas  
and override the Sanhedrin's decision?  
it wasn't what I wanted  
especially after speaking with the man  
who seemed to me naive  
and partly innocent  
but who am I?  
the owner of a title  
procurator - I suppose it sounds impressive  
but really just another bureaucrat  
a cog within the Empire's vast machine  
as such I have no trouble understanding  
why the High Priest and his fellows feared  
this man whose words whose very way  
of being in the world  
threatened their authority and undercut  
the order they and we had worked  
hard to achieve  
the peace all too precarious  
we Romans and this fractious little tribe  
of Palestinians who call themselves  
the Sons of Israel  
and he this Nazarene perhaps the most  
fractious of them all  
his words discounting not only the power  
of Rome but also of the Temple  
and it's servants  
placing his petty god  
above the world's one power  
I mean of course the divine Caesar Agustus  
yes the man was a troublemaker  
and possibly seditious yet I felt  
a certain pang of conscience  
a reluctance to approve his execution  
and now it's done  
I'm sensing a strange loss  
the self-assurance that I took  
for granted has faded while the memory  
of his face lingers like ghost  
haunting my days  
the hours too  
seem to have lost their meaning  
and my dreams recur  
with troubling images and scenes
