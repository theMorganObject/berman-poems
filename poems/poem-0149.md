Perched on a branch  
 above my head  
 three crows  
laughing crow laughter  
 watching me  
 watch them  
what is it?  
 I wonder  
 where's the joke?  
then my gaze wanders  
 to the next  
 tree over  
where a fourth crow  
 missing party  
 to this escapade  
is waiting  
 for my eyes  
 to find him out  
and when they do  
 he briefly joins  
 the raucous chorus  
then lifts off  
 leaving me  
 to stand there mute  
knowing that I've  
 been gifted  
 with a name
