In Bulgakov's novel Jesus says  
the greatest sin of all  
is cowardice  
the novelist  
living through Stalinâ€™s terror  
knew what his Yeshua  
was speaking of  
Stalin's Moscow  
Rome's Jerusalem  
had a thing or two in common  
though it might escape  
a superficial reading  
Bulgakov's Pontius Pilate  
for his lack of courage  
pays a bitter price  
though he is only  
acting out his role

A fearful man  
for all I would be otherwise  
I understand that courage  
means acting justly  
in the face of fear  
not fearlessness  
that is a state of mind  
known only to the few  
I'd give a lot  
to find a bit more courage  
in myself
