In this first global plague year  
since the aftermath  
a hundred years ago  
of world war one  
we stay indoors  
or walk the neighborhood  
inhabiting our homes  
like social badgers  
hunkered down for the duration  
once again our kitchens  
have become the centers  
of what's left of family life  
baking has seen a rise in popularity  
with restaurants largely off limits  
home cooking  
takes on a new importance  
and this cobbler  
made with the apples gathered  
from our fuji  
diced up and topped with oats  
and cinnamon  
coconut oil  
a sprinkling of monks fruit  
baked in the oven till the topping  
turns a toasty brown  
once it's cooled off  
there's no resisting  
and the only question  
will it last beyond today
