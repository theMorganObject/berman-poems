Hard to imagine a shell  
 more fragile  
 more exquisite  
coiled snail-like  
 but no snail made  
 this sea-born wonder  
a mother's work  
 protection  
 for her eggs  
and ballast chamber  
 allowing her  
 to rest  
below the surface  
 floating in  
 the water column  
till the eggs  
 are ready  
 to hatch out

She is the argonaut  
 named for Jason's  
 mythic ship  
pelagic octopus  
 she floats above  
 the ocean depths  
she made this shell  
 pale white  
 nearly translucent  
that now sits  
 on my dresser  
 lovely token  
of the sea's  
 deep magic  
 and the way  
life spirals  
 into beauty  
 forming galaxies  
fern fronds  
 sunflowers and  
 this perfect jewel
