after Wang Wei

The eager dogs  
 go bounding off  
 leading the way

Then circle back  
 to check on us  
 and urge us on

Once entering  
 the woods  
 the air grows still

Late sunlight  
 enters weakly  
 through the pines

Winding along  
 beside the trail  
 the little creek

Flows soundlessly  
 between its  
 mossy banks

Ancient madrones  
 their copper skin  
 smooth to the touch

Delight the eye  
 with fresh green  
 foliage

Our path  
 meanders up  
 the mountainside

I stop to rest  
 while Carroll strides  
 ahead

The dogs with lolling  
 tongues are panting  
 hard

And I too  
 feel impatient  
 to head back
