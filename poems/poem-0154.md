Mid-winter but the day  
is warm and rainy  
almost sultry  
here to tease us  
with a dream  
of spring

At Gilbert Creek  
the willows have  
begun to bud  
launching their catkins  
in anticipation

The streamside alders  
reach their thick black trunks  
upwards some sixty feet  
or more to where they branch  
into a leafless canopy

The water rushing past  
has long since  
washed away the soil  
exposing roots  
that writhe around the base  
like a great nest of snakes

The ground is strewn  
with alder leaves an inch  
or two of wet brown carpet  
covering the grass

The creek  
a muddy brown  
with streaks of white  
is loud as if announcing  
its newly enhanced  
position in the world

The dogs  
delighted to be loose  
from our small yard  
explore the creekside  
sniffing here and there  
in search of mice

And I too  
glad for this free hour  
feel how the weather  
in my soul  
has found reflection  
in the overcast  
the falling rain  
the many subtle  
harbingers of spring
