He called himself  
 wayfaring stranger  
 and he touched me

With his singing  
 strumming on  
 his folk guitar  
Nothing fancy  
 just enough  
 to carry  
What the songs  
 themselves might wish  
 for you to hear

Folksongs from Ireland  
 Scotland  
 Appalachia  
Cowboy songs  
 love songs  
 some bawdy songs too  
Before I'd reached  
 the age of eight  
 he had me  
Though it was many  
 years before  
 I knew  
How deeply  
 I'd been touched  
 by what those songs  
Had taught me  
 about love  
 and poetry  
And the lives of  
 folks whose names  
 were never written  
But whose songs  
 go on uplifting  
 folks like me
