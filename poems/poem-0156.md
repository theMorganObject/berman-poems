Side by side three treasures
hang on the wall
here in my studio
to the right a whistle made
of paired turkey leg bones
bought at a Pomo gathering
back in Mendocino
hung on a strip of rawhide
with shell beads dangling below
the paired tubes notched
at one end
pitched differently
so when they're blown
the sound comes shrill
and piercing

In the center a necklace
I made back in the seventies
of sinew strung with red and blue
Hudson Bay trading beads
and strips of abalone
three strands designed to
brush against eachother
as the dancer sways
making a soft music
that the Yurok call
the water sound

Hanging beside these treasures
on its slender woven strap
a coca bag the Quechua call chuspa
made to hold the leaves
that help with cold and hunger
in the Altiplano
high plain of the Andes

Exquisite craftsmanship
blueblack figures set against
a white background
the weave is unimaginably fine
six lines of prancing horses
four to every line
a middle column
figures of ducks and tiny llamas
on the inside a pocket
for the catalyst called llucta
made from quinoa ash

The bag speaks of
an eye for beauty
and the patience of
the women who have kept
this craft alive through
unnumbered generations
it brings to mind the vibrant
dances of Bolivia
cuecas and morenadas
marineras and sayas
the sound of panpipes
drums and goat-hoof rattles
music I once played
and still hold precious
as I hold this lovely chuspa
