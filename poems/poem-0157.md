It stands there  
on the wooden cabinet top  
the only object  
in my study  
truly black  
round rimmed  
a slightly narrowed neck  
the shoulders gently sloping  
judging by the glaze  
it could be Japanese but no  
the potter was from somewhere  
on the California coast

My mother bought it  
in the town of Mendocino  
where I'd brought her  
from the San Francisco airport  
driving in the dark through miles  
of fog and redwood forest  
following the yellow reflectors  
a bit like Dorothy's  
yellow brick road  
until somewhere near Albion  
we reached the ocean  
then drove north along the narrow  
winding highway  
'till at last we found the comfort  
of a Bed and Breakfast

In the morning woke  
to sunshine pouring  
in the window and outside  
a fabulous blue ocean  
and my mother's smiling face  
this was the only trip  
we'd ever taken  
just the two of us  
and so I guard the memory  
as something precious  
it will be ten years  
this fall since she moved on  
and the black vase  
that she gifted me  
stands empty now  
without its flowers  
but I'll put roses in it  
come the spring  
pink roses from our garden  
once they're back in bloom

on  
a dot of white  
reflection of the ceiling lamp
