After Bai Juyi

1.

Beyond the fence  
 that hides  
 our neighbor's yard

The sound of children  
 splashing in the  
 family pool

Their laughter  
 music to  
 an old man's ears

Comes back on this  
 gray afternoon  
 to warm my soul

2.

In my mind's eye  
 I see our cat  
 stretched in the sun

Pretending he's  
 asleep while waiting  
 for a jay

To land at the  
 birdfeeder on  
 our upper deck

He may not catch  
 the bird but it's  
 well worth the try
