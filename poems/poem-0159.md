Not Shakespeare's heroine  
and not Fellini's  
Giulietta but my only  
Juliette of the Spirits  
such a joy to know  
her joie de vivre  
her bubbling humor  
fine musicianship  
an accomplished cellist  
who'd taken up  
bass viol or better  
viola da gamba  
her seven string bass  
was made by Sato-san  
an instrument  
worthy in every way  
of Bach's gamba sonatas  
but for her  
the color was too red  
and so we traded  
and I came out the winner  
or so I thought  
it's been years now  
since I last saw her  
visiting her Mendocino cottage  
on Albion Ridge Road  
between roads f and g  
so hers of course  
she had to name g flat  
she had laid out  
a tray of tiny glasses  
that she'd filled  
with a variety of home-  
made liqueurs  
one of them I remember  
was walnut and both  
sweet and slightly bitter  
a year later we spoke  
for the last time  
she told me she had cancer  
and was dying  
but was fine  
had no regrets  
had lived the life  
she'd wanted  
now I'm left  
with memories  
regretting only  
that I hadn't spent  
more time with her  
the gamba mostly sits  
inside its case  
I tried to sell it once  
but wasn't able  
to let go of what still  
seemed to connect me  
with that lively and loving spirit
