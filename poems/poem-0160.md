Once In Arequipa  
I heard mestizo music  
violin and guitarron  
anda pair of ten string mandolins  
music to set your feet  
to stamping make you  
want to dance  
the ancient dances  
Inca dances  
with a Spanish flair  
and there in Arequpa  
I tasted the ceviche with aji  
the fiery native peppers  
an initiation bordering  
on religion tried the pisco  
but preferred the beer

Named the white city  
ciudad blanca  
for the old colonial buildings  
built with pink-white bricks  
that men still quarry  
from the slopes of el Misti  
Peru's own Fuji-san  
just over nineteen thousand  
feet show-capped  
and still releasing whispy  
fumaroles the mountain's  
dozing only half asleep  
she woke again and roared  
not ten years after  
I had come and gone  
I was on my way to  
higher places  
Puno on lake Titicaca  
and by train along the Vilcanota  
north to Machu Picchu  
sitting on the train  
that took us up from Arequipa  
climbing slowly into the high Andes  
I strummed the little armadillo  
backed charango that my brother  
brought me from Bolivia  
and sang a song by the  
guitarist, poet, singer  
Atahualpa Yupanqui  
a song of how the mountain stream  
calls out and pleads with you  
to turn back to the mountains  
to the home you've left behind  
Tu que puedes, vuelvete  
You who can, go back again  
I sang softly and the woman  
neither old nor young  
sitting across from me  
began to cry
