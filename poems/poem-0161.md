Inauguration day  
and here's this young  
well spoken  
black woman  
Amanda Gorman  
whose not so distant  
ancestors were slaves  
reading beautifully  
the poem she wrote  
for the new President  
Vice-President and just appointed  
cabinet members  
for the whole country and indeed  
for all the world  
to hear and see what's truly great  
about America  
what still engenders hope  
past all our deep  
divides and all the ugly  
stories of slavery  
racism and injustice  
this woman's words  
her smiling face  
expressive gestures  
a gift to all of us  
gladly received  
a gift one hopes  
will be repayed with something  
more than just words  
however beautifully  
hers have conveyed the task  
the many tasks  
that lie before us  
hers was a moment  
that will reverberate  
through time  
and will be noted  
by good people  
everywhere
