It's my great-grandfather  
Rebbe Chaim Elya  
in jacket and bow tie  
his hat suggests  
a Turkish fez his lips  
a pale line hardly showing  
between his moustache  
and his rich black beard

He faces me  
gazing with steady eyes  
across the little space we share  
here in my room  
and the much wider space  
that separates  
the lives we've led  
the worlds we've known  
his portrait leans against the wall  
and in his gaze  
I see a kindly questioning  
concern  
for the condition  
of my soul

Few of us get to know  
our great-grandparents  
in childhood I was blessed  
by what they left  
behind them  
these two gentle folk  
two old world jews  
Chaim Elya and Chaya Sarah  
a gift of spirit that shone in the eyes  
of their third daughter  
my beloved grandma Emma  
whose love like summer sun  
was unconditional  
and warmed me  
to the marrow of my bones
