Praise to you lightfooted one  
youthful messenger  
bright spirit  
god of thieves and liars  
sailors, alchemists  
interpreters of sacred texts  
pathfinder through the underworld  
you are the one forever lurking  
in the shadows  
in the doorways between worlds  
healer and guide of souls

How often have I caught  
the flash of winged sandals  
glimpsed a sudden brightening  
in the air a quickness  
that left my dull senses  
far behind and yet  
slow as I am  
I'm ever quick to lose my keys  
my purse my purpose  
to forget where I set down  
my book my glasses where I  
parked my car and  
quick to lose myself  
moving heedlessly on  
to the next thought  
the next distraction

Yet somehow all the many  
things I lose  
find their way back to me  
show up behind the couch  
in my shirt pocket  
underneath my pillow  
and even the large losses  
youthful hopes and aspirations  
long abandoned  
seem to come around again  
with time  
thanks to your gift  
divine Hermes  
trickster who gave the world  
the first plucked strings  
to soothe our hearts  
with gentle sounds  
accept our thanks for all  
the play of lost and found  
and making whole again
