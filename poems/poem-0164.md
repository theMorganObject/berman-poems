Descending in the semidark  
leaving the heat  
the brilliant sunshine  
monkeys howling  
through the forest canopy  
stepping gingerly  
down the long passage  
to arrive  
in that small chamber  
dimly lit with its sarcophagus  
of heavy stone  
where once a Mayan king  
had been laid out  
in state and carefully  
prepared to undertake the journey  
to Xibalba

I stood a moment by the empty tomb  
then climbed the many steps  
back to the daylight world  
and tired from a week of travels  
and the heat  
sat down to rest  
on a stone bench beside  
the ruins of an ancient temple

All at once  
I was a Mayan priest  
holding a bowl  
to catch the blood that spouted  
from the heart I'd plucked  
out of a human sacrifice  
blood that I knew was needed  
for the world's renewal  
for life and for the blessing  
of the gods

Waking from my trance  
I felt a wave  
rush up my spine  
as if to reaffirm  
the truth of what I'd seen  
what I'd been shown  
a former life  
or perhaps simply  
another possibility  
either way I left those ruins  
knowing something I'd not known  
before nor would have guessed  
about myself  
about the mystery  
the power residing  
even after centuries  
in the Mayan earth  
at Palenque
