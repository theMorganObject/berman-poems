for my grandson Dylan

Walking out along the road  
that ends a hundred yards  
south of the house I built  
at Big Lagoon we came  
my son and I to where we  
could look down  
on Agate Beach and there  
below us standing on a dune  
in fading sunlight color matching  
perfectly the tawny sand  
a cougar so I said hey Daniel  
look, a lion and he said  
aw dad it's just a dog  
but then the animal  
ran like a streak  
straight up the bank  
its long tail trailing  
out behind and my excited  
ten year old exclaimed  
"That was a CAT!"
