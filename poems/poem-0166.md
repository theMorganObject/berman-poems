Even if it didn't last  
turning too soon to rain  
the snow that we woke up to  
is still falling gently falling  
somewhere in the backyard  
of my mind

The soft wet flakes that settled  
in the clover by the path  
and turned the crisscross maple twigs  
to delicate white lace  
have abdicated to the rain  
vanished without a trace  
but still the whiteness lingers  
in the garden of my mind

The cat and dogs are fed and stretched  
out in their favorite spots  
and I'm ensconced in my warm study  
thinking winter thoughts  
remembering the falling snow  
a blessing from on high  
even if it turned too soon to rain
