Strange how you walk  
into a room and come out  
not the person  
that you were  
before you innocently  
entered through the door

I think of Simon Peter  
a simple fisherman encountering  
as if by chance a man  
whose face  
whose words revealed  
love's hidden possibilities  
a man you couldn't walk  
away from couldn't simply  
turn around and go back  
to the life you'd known before

Love can do that to us  
and so can truth when we  
encounter it in unexpected  
places finding something  
in ourselves or in another  
something that we never  
once imagined never thought  
to look for but that shakes us  
to our very core

I saw this once  
a woman in a line  
waiting to meet  
the Dalai Lama  
she was smiling  
full of happy expectation  
confident of what awaited her  
and then her turn came up  
and such surprise such wonder  
and astonishment showed in her face  
I knew she'd caught a glimpse  
of something real  
something to carry her  
across the river  
even to the farther shore
