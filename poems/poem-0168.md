I must be a musician after all  
I don't remember the dance troupe  
or the routines  
but I do remember  
the dapper Mr Cage  
sitting off to one side  
at a card table  
and while the dancers broke  
to change their costumes  
he kept up a light patter  
telling jokes and every now and then  
he'd pop the cork on one  
of the champagne bottles  
set down beside his chair  
the corks would fly  
some thirty feet straight up  
into the air with a clear popping sound  
heard throughout the hall  
and every time he'd waited  
just long enough to make it a surprise  
he wasn't even drinking the champagne  
just using it to make a kind  
of chamber music
