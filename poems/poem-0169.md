from her loving husband

Not every marriage  
 can be blamed  
 on heaven  
or attributed  
 to heaven's  
 healing grace  
but ours, my love  
 attests to  
 many angels  
doing their job  
 arranging  
 time and place  
and circumstance  
 so you and I  
 could meet  
at the first moment  
 we could both  
 be there  
open to all  
 the loving possi-  
 bilities  
our hearts and minds  
 and bodies  
 could explore  
first I had  
 to play my native  
 flute for you  
An ploy of which  
 I knew Coyote  
 would approve  
and then you had  
 to show me  
 you could wrestle  
my broken rib  
 a token  
 of our love  
though we were still  
 too new to know  
 the whole of it  
or what the higher  
 powers had  
 in mind  
it wasn't long  
 before we felt  
 the truth of it  
and now I'm first  
 to say the gods  
 were kind
