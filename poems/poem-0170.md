Cow pie mushrooms was the other name  
we called them up in Humboldt County  
back in the 70s when friends of mine  
were living in a redwood stump  
and I would sit on tables  
in the Epicurean and sing  
for hours the songs I'd learned  
from Baez  
Belafonte and Burl Ives

Back then the mushrooms  
were easy picking  
though I a newcomer and city boy  
needed to be shown  
I can remember the first time  
how quick the laughter rose  
up in my throat  
and how the young pine trees  
seemed rooted in some underground  
electric field that set  
each separate needle sparking  
from the current flowing up the trunk  
and how the smell of those same needles  
reached my nostrils like a basket  
of exotic fruit and how  
I knew that I was seeing  
tasting smelling the world  
for the first time
