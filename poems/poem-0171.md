We humans  
children of the polar ice  
how will it be for us  
for our kind  
when the great ice sheets  
are gone?

Not so easy  
say the arctic foxes  
hard times coming  
say the walruses  
we worry for you  
say the polar bears

We'll be gone but you  
will have your hands full  
in a world like none  
you've ever known  
better get moving  
and we wish you luck
