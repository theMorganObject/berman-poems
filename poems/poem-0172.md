My local father  
she called me  
hiding her feelings  
That was a gift  
since I would  
not have known  
How to respond  
to this young  
married woman  
Mother of  
a beautiful  
young son

We traded classical  
guitar for  
Japanese  
Translated one  
another's  
poetry  
I learned only  
a little of  
her childhood  
and how the man  
she'd married  
brought her here  
We made a chapbook  
with her art  
my photos  
Memories  
of Kyoto  
nineteen sixty-nine  
The year that turned  
my life around and  
freed me  
To leave  
the academic  
pantomime

We did a reading  
of our poems  
when my mother  
Was visiting  
something special  
for her and me  
A moment that's  
still vivid  
and still treasured  
As I still treasure  
this dear  
and special friend  
Friend of  
many years now  
many lifetimes  
Unless I am  
mistaken  
so I write  
To wish her  
every blessing  
every happiness  
That's possible  
in this  
conflicted time

Dressed up  
in her kimono  
she's the soul  
Of lovliness  
of modest grace  
and light  
I thank the gods  
who brought us two  
together  
Such friends  
are few in any  
one man's life
