Heading back to Malaga  
from Marrakesh  
got off the train at Meknes  
for the night  
before boarding the ferry  
in Tangier  
ended up staying an extra day

That afternoon the streets  
filled up with people  
waiting for the king  
Mohammed VI  
to make a rare appearance  
soon security  
the royal guard  
officials sporting uniforms  
of various stripes and colors  
ran all around  
checking out the crowd

Where we were standing  
a band of percussionists  
and horn players  
with medieval trumpets  
five feet long  
were making a great racket  
while the dancers  
half a dozen younger men  
under the eye  
of one old timer tried  
heroically to keep the beat  
we watched this happen  
two days in a row  
as hundreds  
maybe thousands gathered  
pushing for a place  
up in the front  
the king of course  
never did appear
