Summer 2018

Statuesque except that seems  
too cold a word for her  
this warm and gracious woman  
come from Sweden to the shade  
of Mendocino's coastal redwoods  
here to share with us  
the songs she loves  
folksongs, sea chanties  
rounds and love songs  
each a joy to learn  
like vintage marbles chosen  
for their varied colors  
little treasures made more precious  
by the memory of singing them  
together in our circle  
eager pupils led by lovely  
clear-voiced Eva  
for that week in June  
the very soul of Sweden
