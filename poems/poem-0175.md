Well I remember her  
the Steamship Nobska  
launched in nineteen twenty-five  
just shy of twenty years  
before my own launching

Queen of the Sounds  
they called her  
built in Maine  
at the Bath Ironworks  
she made the run  
from Woods Hole to the Islands  
and New Bedford

I still recall a crossing in September  
when the swells were such  
to make her pitch and roll  
as if we were at sea  
a small adventure yet  
enough for a young boy  
to feel the ocean's power  
and mystery

Slender and elegant  
unlike the ferries  
that came after her  
her sharp bow cut  
through winter ice  
when others couldn't  
she was the last  
of all our coastal steamers  
retired in '73  
and later scrapped

Her portrait done in oils  
hangs on my wall  
smoke streaming from the stack  
under a sky  
of windblown clouds  
behind her on the far horizon  
rise a schooner's sails  
perhaps the Shenandoah  
moored in Vineyard Haven harbor  
for the tourists  
a reminder of the days  
now distant memory  
of sailing ship that braved  
our seas and coasts

The Nobska too belongs now  
to another time  
and looking at the print  
up on my wall  
it's not hard to feel  
the same about myself  
but mostly it's the thanks  
for all I've seen  
of ships and oceans  
as a child and later too  
that wells up in my throat  
bringing me close  
to tears but not of sadness  
only gratitude
