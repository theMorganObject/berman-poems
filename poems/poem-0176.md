My first wife danced  
before I met her  
in a group  
of Balkan dancers  
she played for me  
Croatian folktunes  
I told myself  
that's the last music  
I'd ever want to play  
she gave it up  
but after a few years  
it drew me in and now  
it's been nearly four decades  
I've been playing for folk dances  
learning to feel  
those fifteen/sixteen rythms  
playing gadulka  
macedonian kaval

In my early twenties  
I saw the movie Jules et Jim  
about a love triangle  
with an unhappy ending  
I told myself  
that's the last way  
I'd ever want to live  
and five years later  
there I was sharing a house  
with my wife  
her boyfriend  
and the young woman  
she'd picked out for me

I was just driving  
though this uninspiring town  
when my car broke down  
it took a week to get the parts  
I told myself  
this is the last place  
I'd ever want to live  
but ten years later  
thanks to love  
it's where I landed  
now another decade's passed  
and I've no thoughts of moving on  
I wonder if  
I've finally learned my lesson
