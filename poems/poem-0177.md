Too small I think for wearing  
then used how?  
the face is delicately carved  
the dark wood old  
and polished  
forehead slightly shiny  
as if with sweat  
the eyes cast down  
and closed but not  
completely  
long narrow nose  
lips neither pursed  
nor open  
not smiling neither frowning  
rather a look of inwardness  
of contemplation  
tiny ears placed  
slightly far forward  
the hat of tightly woven twine  
also dark brown rises above  
to make what doubtless was  
a noble crest but with neglect  
is now a snarl of loose ends  
down the back  
and sides the netting drapes  
widening out a bit  
below the chin  
like a knight's  
chainmail coif  
there is a look of  
of noble resignation not entirely  
sad but hardly joyful  
the mask suggests  
the wisdom of experience  
eyes that have seen  
what the world has to offer  
for good and evil both  
and now turned inward  
have found a source of peace
