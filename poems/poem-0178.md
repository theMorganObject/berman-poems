are neither blue nor brown  
hazel is closer  
but still not quite right  
they seem to change  
depending on the light  
or maybe on her mood  
it's hard to say  
she calls them swamp colored  
I beg to differ  
they make me think of amber  
or dark honey  
a she-lions tawny coat  
more often though  
it's spices come to mind  
with hints of saffron  
cinnamon and light green dill  
wide open and inquisitive  
not shy  
yet elusive as the colors  
in the soapstone bowl  
of my precious Yurok pipe

But it's not about the colors  
it's the places  
her eyes have taken me  
the things  
that they've taught me to see  
the silences  
the depths they've drawn me into  
and with all the daily fare  
of disappointments  
anger, sorrow, laughter  
it's those moments  
when her eyes brim over  
with the soft light of her love  
a revelation  
that wakes me from my dream  
and brings me back  
time after time  
back to the one  
reality that makes this world  
my world a home
