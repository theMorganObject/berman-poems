for W.S. Merwin

So long I've waited  
listening for the dusk  
to fall with all its twittering  
of birds  
as they return to where  
it is birds go  
to sleep away the hours  
of darkness and we too  
can put aside the cares  
the day has brought  
and now at last  
my waiting is rewarded  
with this soft twilight hour  
this precious moment  
of stillness  
and of peace
