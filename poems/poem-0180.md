Beyond the window  
the countryside moves past  
at seventy  
maybe eighty miles an hour  
just across from me  
my teacher  
Master Hua  
the only fearless man  
I've ever known  
You have to jump  
he says to me  
I'll die I say  
no you won't  
just trust me  
and somehow I do  
so out the window  
and the next thing I know  
I'm sitting by the tracks  
watching the train  
rush off into the distance  
at my back  
the forest trees are trembling  
and I feel  
such a deep sense of relief  
knowing at last  
my real life has begun
