A certain poet  
having decided to outdo  
the great twelfth century master  
Lu You by surpassing  
his output of some nine thousand  
surviving poems  
an impressive number  
though less than half  
the twenty thousand  
that Chinese prodigy  
is reputed to have written  
once our poet  
had passed the seven thousand mark  
he'd so forgotten  
his early work that he began  
writing the exact same poems  
word for word  
only from time to time  
he changed the line breaks  
and this went on  
for many years  
this duplication of his former work  
so that in later times  
the academic critics  
and eager graduate students  
had much to argue over  
what was the meaning  
of the slightly shifted lines  
and in truth  
many a doctoral thesis  
emerged from just this  
quirk of forgetfulness  
which only proves  
ah but what does it prove?
