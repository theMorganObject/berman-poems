Was it ever really lost  
or was it you  
lost in your private thoughts  
lost in your work  
caught up in the net  
of obligations  
failing to note the ebbing  
of the tide

We work at making time  
as if it were  
blueberry muffins  
trouble or a joke  
think of it like  
a bank account that could  
run out of funds  
thanks to our spendthrift ways

We watch the sand fall  
through the glass  
as grain by grain  
the hours and minutes  
seem to slip away  
watch the shadow  
creep across the dial  
tilting toward the sunset  
of our days

Nothing is lost forever  
nothing we've loved  
a watchful mother  
time finds us  
where we hide  
behind the garden wall  
under the holly  
and as darkness falls  
she takes us back inside
