after Liu Tsung-yuan

One year they stayed  
nested and sadly lost  
their hatchling babies  
to the bigmouth bass  
today though  
they were only passing through  
or so it seemed  
this being a good month  
for choosing mates  
but early still for thoughts  
of settling down  
as I approached they hid  
under the rose  
whose long canes overarch  
the water's edge  
at the pond's end  
if wood ducks  
were like mallards  
common fare  
would we still  
take them in  
with such delight?  
I think we would  
such elegant design  
subtle and yet striking  
without resort  
to irridescent colors  
so I hope  
that they'll be back  
now that the bass are gone
