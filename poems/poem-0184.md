Waking from my dream  
I had the feeling  
that something was amiss  
I left the room  
walked down the stairs  
and saw the front door open  
though I knew  
I'd closed it  
only hours before  
I stepped outside  
the sky was dark  
alive with stars  
the trees stood silent  
pressing close  
up to the house  
and there  
at the wood's edge  
I saw him standing  
watching as I turned  
to look his way  
no fear only  
a sense of exultation  
and sympathy  
such as one might feel  
seeing the earth  
from space  
or from a distance  
a lion chasing down  
a young gazelle  
we stood awhile  
gazing at one another  
across the deep divide  
that lay between  
then he turned  
and stepped away  
into the forest  
and I thought  
my house will never  
be the same
