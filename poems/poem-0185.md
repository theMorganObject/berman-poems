for her 16th birthday

At two already  
she had my number  
How come you got  
that pouty face  
grandpa Steve?  
and that before  
I was even out of bed  
with her in pjs  
sitting on my chest  
hard to imagine  
she's a young woman now  
sixteen this sunday  
with social smarts beyond  
any that I've known  
or ever will  
and soccer skills  
the family athlete  
though younger brother Reed  
may someday match her  
his game is tennis  
no competition there  
and Dylan  
her twin brother  
leaves the field wide open  
prefering music  
to chasing after balls  
though I've been told  
all three are decent swimmers  
but Kyla  
grown as tall or taller  
than her mother  
is primed I think to break  
a heart or two  
my own is hurting  
too much time apart  
with any luck  
and with our vaccinations  
we'll get to visit  
before the month is through!
