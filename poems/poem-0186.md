Were we friends?  
he kept me at a distance  
while honoring my path  
that was his way  
not just with me  
with many of us  
who loved him  
for his passion  
his spiritual intensity

Even his anger  
drew us  
and the way it came through  
when he sang  
his chants were powerful  
some wild,  
others sweet enough  
to summon shabbos angels  
all had raw energy  
when he performed  
with his deep voice  
and unrythmic guitar

He loved the wild  
hunted for eagle feathers  
searched for ways to bring us  
back to the hills, the land  
a was a caring  
husband, father  
teacher, rabbi, friend  
his death by drowning  
seemed incongruous  
can it be that God is jealous  
of those he loves the most?

After twelve years  
last night he came  
the same Reb Aryeh  
we sat together  
shared a shabbos meal  
Beth and the children  
present at the table  
he turned to me  
with clear intent and said  
is it not time for a memorial  
performance of my songs  
the melodies I brought down  
from on high?

He left me with that thought  
that task to ponder  
shalom aleichem dear Reb Aryeh  
peace be upon you  
now and in the World to Come  
your niggunim  
your sacred chants live on  
you are honored and remembered  
well among our holy dead  
and if I live to present  
one more concert  
in the Havurah  
your songs will once again  
take pride of place
