Awake my sleeper to the sun ...  
 The fences of the light are down  
 And worlds hang from the trees  
 Dylan Thomas

Named for that other Dylan  
much admired  
Welsh wordsmith  
whose metaphor  
for song as fire  
as act  
burning and crested  
fire of birds  
in the world's woods  
encouraged me  
to turn my life  
around by claiming  
for myself that gift  
the songs of childhood  
seeds of music  
that my family had sown  
without their seeing  
the full value  
of what sprang  
from that well-seeded ground

This young man  
whose sensitive  
way with words  
is only matched  
by his musical flair  
reminds me at times  
of myself at that age  
or rather the person  
I would have wished  
to be had I not  
been so wrapped up  
in myself

I remember when he  
was hardly past toddlerhood  
how intrigued he was  
by the natural world  
and the words for things  
describing a find  
a shell was it?  
on the beach as a  
nunique specimen

And how when I showed him  
a ring-necked snake  
on a path by our summer  
home on the Vineyard  
he being two or three  
at the time  
exclaimed  
now that is a treat!

His poem Thirteen  
Ways of Looking  
at Lightning  
evoking the great  
Wallace Stevens  
stunned even his teacher  
who wrote the word Wow!  
which was my response  
as well but I doubt  
that our Dylan knew  
Stevens lived next door  
to my father's father  
Saul Berman in Hartford  
Connecticut  
that they often took  
the trolley together  
to work in the morning  
my grandfather having  
no inkling that his  
companion was thought  
by many to be  
the greatest living  
American poet

Too soon perhaps  
for his parents  
or me  
but not for himself  
he'll be off on his way  
to college  
to romance and learning  
and who knows what  
or where  
Santa Cruz like his father?  
Harvard like me?  
maybe back to San Luis to study  
the sea life he loves  
but certainly music  
will always be part  
of the life he chooses  
and poetry maybe  
literature certainly  
math like his mother  
physics and chemistry  
these he is already tasting  
in highschool  
such a rich world  
as the lines quoted  
above and written  
by his own namesake  
say better than I  
ever coud
