A fish with speckled scales  
like pale brown sand  
swims thoughtfully  
past clumps of dark green kelp  
that hide a seahorse  
with black fins and orange eye  
tail curled tight  
in the way of seahorses  
a dolphin follows close  
and nudging him  
a blue-carapaced turtle  
flippers spread like wings  
is paddling just above  
a spiral shell

Newly made  
the pot looks somehow  
ancient  
pre-colombian  
although the colors are  
perhaps a bit  
too bright too clear  
the potter worthy scion  
of some gifted ancestor  
has taught his hands  
to shape the clay  
into a well  
proportioned form  
and also  
as the pot reveals  
has learned to swim  
with eyes wide open  
taking in the beauty  
of the ocean world
