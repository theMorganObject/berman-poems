A Curse

Abbettors of violence and lies  
Overseeing the rise  
Of our homegrown American fascism  
Where corporate money is king  
May you never again be at peace  
May your dreams be filled the scene  
Of our Capitol under seige  
With a would-be Mussolini  
Urging on his violent cohorts  
May your days be haunted with knowing  
How you failed the nation, the world  
Disgraced yourselfves and your office  
By your lack of integrity, courage  
To do what you knew in your hearts  
To be right before God, before history  
May your reputations forever  
Be corroded like rotted old iron  
A stain on the country's blotter  
May your grandchildren find you pitiful  
May you come to suffer the knowledge  
Of how and why you failed  
Your own and your country's honor  
And the price of your cowardly greed!!
