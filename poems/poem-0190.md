How would we have survived  
these dismal times  
without his wonderfully  
dark humor  
who else  
what other voice  
could have us laughing  
over a lanced boil  
or a pet spider  
named April who requires  
a daily search  
for home-caught flies  
who else could make  
the comedy of errors  
that constitute our lives  
our families  
our fears and foibles  
seem so laughable  
forgivable  
hilariously human  
while paying tribute  
to the love and constancy  
that make it  
not just bearable  
but worth our while
