for my wife Carroll

For you love I am glad to wear  
my heart upon my sleeve  
but this one morning  
there it was  
up on the screen  
resembling a fetus  
on an ultrasound  
pulsing and burbling  
like a creature  
from the depths  
indistinct but showing  
tiny valves that flapped  
in sequence  
seeming nothing more  
than flimsy bits of thread

I find it hard to think  
my life depends  
on their precise  
uninterrupted movement  
but now I've seen them  
work to whoosh the blood along  
these little valves  
seem a true miracle  
of evolution  
like lilliputian workers  
in the factory  
that is my heart  
they labor tirelessly  
churning out time  
this precious time  
I have to spend with you
