Tolstoy would have been touched  
by the way that grandpa read it  
every summer to us grandchildren  
as we sprawled on the rug  
in the livingroom of Phaleron  
his summer home  
a modest house on Marthas Vineyard  
built in nineteen thirty-five  
before the island was "discovered"  
and things were relatively cheap  
and he had work despite  
the general hard times

It's the story of an angel  
sent back to earth because  
he couldn't bring himself to take  
the life of a young mother  
so that God had to dispatch  
another less free-thinking angel  
while this one learned  
some basic lessons of  
the human world

But even if the orphaned infants  
went on to good and happy lives  
I never found the story  
with its message of a God  
whose purpose was unknowable  
whose ways were always  
just and perfect  
despite the reverence I felt  
for my beloved grandfather  
I never found the story  
quite convincing
