Fifty years since I first heard mbira  
accompanied by the gourd rattle  
called hosho  
and women's high-voiced singing  
songs from Africa  
gift of the Shona people  
of Zimbabwe  
which from first hearing  
entered deep and drew me  
to find teachers  
learn to play myself  
the tunes the Shona play  
to draw their ancestors  
into their homes for healing  
for dance and celebration  
so this music  
heals my soul as well  
though I've not called  
on distant ancestors  
I know we have them  
all of us  
Anglo and Inuit  
Lakota and Chinese  
we all came from  
that birthplace of humanity  
called Africa  
perhaps that's why  
this music touches me  
so deeply  
brings a quiet joy  
as if I were  
a baby lying half asleep  
across his mother's breast
