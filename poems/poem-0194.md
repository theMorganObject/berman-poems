This artist caught it perfectly  
two orange carp  
with grey translucent fins  
backs speckled  
with black dots  
the white rice paper  
serving as water  
from above  
a wisp of willow dangles  
greygreen leaves  
daintily branching off the stem  
though not Chinese  
she caught the way  
that Chinese artists see  
the living world  
of birds and flowers  
dragonflies and fish  
not as we westerners  
who tend to look on from outside  
life's magic circle  
but with a sense  
of deep connection  
like fond cousins  
sharing the same dream
