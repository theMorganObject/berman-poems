Long ago  
when I could still breathe  
underwater  
I'd watch as brightly colored fish  
swam past  
and feel my body  
stretching back forever  
into the reaches  
of my coral cave  
then suddenly I'd be  
all teeth and jaws  
lunging forward to snap up  
some careless swimmer  
no thought coming between  
impulse and act

There was an ecstacy  
in being weightless  
so intimate a part  
of the reef world  
whose waves would rock me  
as they passed above  
whose currents set  
my fins to undulating  
there was a freedom then  
that I've not felt  
except in dreams  
since I became a man
