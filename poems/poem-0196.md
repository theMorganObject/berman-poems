Raised on my lap  
as newly hatched out chicks  
Dover and Devon were  
my special ones  
lovely to my eyes  
their speckled feathers  
white dots elegant  
against the chestnut brown  
since Roman times they'd  
been a British breed  
good layers hardy stock  
the fearful night  
a raccoon took their  
less resilient sisters  
they somehow knew just  
where and how to hide  
they liked to follow me  
around the yard  
as if I were the mother  
that they never knew  
they'd let me ruff their necks  
and their bright eyes  
reflected back my own  
deep curiousity  
could it have been a kind  
of chicken love?  
I think at very least  
we were good friends
