left us yesterday  
for good  
departing quietly  
from his San Francisco home  
from the city  
he had honored by his work  
and which in turn  
saw fit to honor him  
he lived an active life  
and long  
he'd made it  
to a hundred years plus one  
and time  
had only served to sweeten him  
his wry smile  
near the end  
was warm  
the hard-won  
innocence  
of a man  
who's seen the world  
for what it is and then  
chosen the lyric side of life  
the lyric out  
as he himself  
once called it  
may his soul now  
find peace among the ranks  
of angel artists  
activists  
heaven's Beat poets  
may he continue  
his insurgence there on high  
shaking up heaven  
as he shook this world below
