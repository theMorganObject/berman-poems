I'm thinking of a day  
an afternoon  
spent on the beach  
near Lambert's Cove  
facing the Sound  
my mother sat in her beach chair  
for hours  
playing contentedly  
as if a child  
with the beach stones  
yellow, pink, and grey  
wave washed and smooth  
that lay there in the sand  
about her feet  
most were the size  
of cantalopes or yams  
and when the time  
came to head home  
she had me fill  
a little knapsack  
to carry on my shoulders  
through the woods  
a quarter mile  
back to the car  
they must have weighed  
thirty or forty pounds  
she was imagining  
how nice they'd look  
edging her summer garden  
I thought she must still see me  
as her big strong boy  
the words she used  
a bit in shock  
after my bipass surgery  
I was glad  
that I could make her happy  
that day  
simply by bringing stones  
back from the beach
