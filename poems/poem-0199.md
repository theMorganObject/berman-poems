Because I took a spear  
stuck in the ground  
beside its owner's grave  
thinking to use it  
as a crutch to lean on  
being by then  
almost too weak to stand  
they thought I was  
the spirit of the dead man  
being white and thus  
clearly a ghost  
who'd come back  
to the world of flesh and blood  
they welcomed me into  
the the family  
of the deceased

They were the Wathaurong  
hunters and fishermen  
who roasted fat  
witchetty grubs  
grilled wombat meat  
they saved my life  
from them  
I learned the secrets  
of the land  
its songs and stories  
how to glean its riches  
thirty-two years  
the best years of my life  
I shared their world  
but in the end I had  
to make a choice  
and I went back  
to join the English  
who had transported me  
for a petty crime  
I never did commit  
I knew the life  
I had been living  
with my Wathaurong  
brothers and sisters  
was coming to an end  
as ships and colonists  
kept on arriving  
and the diseases  
that came with them  
were killing off the ones  
the whites called aborigines  
savages they thought them  
though I knew better  
I could say but little  
since despite my pardon  
I was never free  
of mistrust and suspician  
having lived so long  
a life of savagery
