Interesting how a family of elk  
idling by the fence  
as you drive up  
slowly now  
to the house at dusk  
and the herd sire  
raises his heavy head  
to stare at you  
for just a moment then goes back  
to grazing with the others  
how that changes everything  
and would do so even if  
the moon weren't full  
above the eastern hills  
and the air motionless  
before the coming rain
