Why is it that I find  
these dark brown canes  
more beautiful  
than their pale cousins  
is it at heart  
an unacknowledged  
racial preference? or simply  
that they stand out  
being far less common?  
regardless of the reason  
I am taken prisoner  
esthetically speaking  
by these slender stalks  
their color setting off  
so perfectly the delicate  
green leaves
