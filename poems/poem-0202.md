From the outside  
the museum seemed  
quite ordinary  
as I entered I was drawn  
off to the right  
where an entire wall  
was hung with handmade quilts  
there was one quilt  
that stood out  
as I approached  
stitched together  
from what appeared  
to be a jumble  
of patchwork pieces  
every sort  
of size and shape  
colors that glowed  
with vibrant greens  
reds, yellows, indigos  
entranced I stood awhile  
taking it in  
before I noticed  
that the center was in motion  
alive and pulsing  
then I knew it was a dream  
and I awoke  
aware that I'd been gifted  
with a image of my patchwork life  
a work of seeming disarray  
but held together  
at the center  
by this beating heart
