It was at Lafferty's  
on the South Shore  
where I met my first wife  
James was there often  
hanging out with friends  
strumming his guitar  
I was imagining myself  
a serious contender  
a Harvard undergrad  
learning to read Chinese  
and thinking he was frittering  
away his precious time  
then came the first album  
with songs that struck  
so deep a chord  
Fire and Rain  
songs that I loved  
and loved to sing myself  
once I had given up  
the professorial fantasy  
it was a lesson learned  
and one that I'm  
still grateful for
