I hear people say  
or is it just in movies?  
if I had it to do over  
I wouldn't change a thing  
not me  
so many things  
that I'd do differently  
given the chance  
but we all know  
the only chance is now  
yet there are moments  
in any life  
that's not cut short  
when time circles back  
and what we'd thought  
was gone forever  
shows up again  
though in a new  
and different form  
it's as if the work  
of making whole  
were part of life's design  
part of her ongoing effort  
to surprise us
