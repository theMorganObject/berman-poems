South from Yerushalayim  
cruising along the Dead Sea shore  
with my new friend  
then up into the hills  
the day was sunny  
hot though only April  
rounding a bend  
we spotted a road kill  
and stopped to look  
African porcupine  
impressive quills  
eight or ten inches  
pretty things  
with alternating bands  
of brown and white  
gingerly I pulled a few  
for souvenirs  
next thing we knew  
an army jeep  
pulled up behind us  
three men in uniform  
jumped out  
one grabbed the roadkill  
by the tail and held it  
to his nose  
sniffed here and there  
and with his hand  
made a clean sweep  
midway across the body  
then his friend  
took a knife and cut  
where the first soldier  
had run his hand to show  
the meat was safe  
I thought  
tough guys these native sons  
that's not a dish  
I could imagine bringing home  
for dinner
