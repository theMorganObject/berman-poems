A country torn  
by civil war  
for decades now  
I've never been there  
nor has anyone I know  
all I do know  
is what I've read  
in magazines  
heard on the radio  
and still my heart goes out  
above all to the women  
who because of us  
meaning the U.S and its  
European allies  
have tasted opportunities  
they'd never had  
for education  
work outside the home  
a voting presence  
and a voice in government  
a long step closer  
to equality with men  
and now despite American lives  
lost and money spent  
over two trillian dollars!  
we are exiting  
which means handing the country  
over to the Taliban  
who will do their best  
to take it back  
a thousand years  
we know too well  
what that would mean  
for half the population  
not blessed with membership  
in the boys club  
may it not come to pass!
