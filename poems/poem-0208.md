Looking down from Big Lagoon to Agate Beach  
I watch the seabirds drifting in the wind  
The sun is going down just out of reach  
in my heart I know I must begin again

refrain  
Pick up the thread you lost, pick up the thread  
Follow back to where your heart was whole  
Pick up the thread you lost, pick up the thread  
The dream you left behind was just your soul

I'm standing in the sand watching the waves  
Singing the words the wind blows to my mind  
My head is full of broken yesterdays  
But today I'll follow where my path will wind

refrain

There is music in the thunder of the waves  
There is music in the rushing of the wind  
There is music in the seagull's raucous cry  
In my heart I know I must begin again

refrain

Looking down from Big Lagoon to Agate Beach  
I watch the seabirds drifting in the wind  
The sun is going down just out of reach  
In my heart I know I must begin again  
In my heart I know I must begin again
