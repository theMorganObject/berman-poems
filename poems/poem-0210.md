a salute to Wang Wei (699-759)

The woods are even quieter  
after the rain  
no movement  
only the dogs frisking  
along the trail  
that winds  
through stands of oak  
and twisty limbed madrones  
no rustling of leaves  
only the sound  
of water trickling down  
making a rivulet  
such stillness  
even my breathing threatens  
to intrude  
on either side  
my eye is drawn  
by pale green lichens  
that frost the slender branches  
of the pines  
the chill of March  
keeps me from lingering  
the dogs have had their fun  
time to head home
