What does it tell us  
that the Chinese artist  
with writing brush  
and fresh ground ink  
on a silk scroll  
has taken the bamboo  
its shoots its culms  
its nodes and internodes  
its papery leaves  
rendered with a single stroke  
has taken this  
as his or her foundation  
the practice of a lifetime  
as a violinist  
however skilled  
will continue daily  
to practice scales  
arpeggios and double stops

For us westerners  
since Greece and Rome  
the human body has been  
central to our art  
based on anatomy  
an effort to convey  
the living form  
in all its density  
its depth  
gift of the ancient Greeks  
with their erotic  
and unabashed athleticism  
then with the Church's  
focus on God's body  
in all its physicality  
upon the cross

By contrast the bamboo  
is light and airy  
empty at the core  
easily bending  
before the wind  
able to shake off winter snows  
ride out the summer storms  
something the artist  
scholar and bureaucrat  
might well admire  
and strive to emulate  
while meditating  
on what the brush  
can only just suggest  
the emptiness  
hidden within the heart  
of the bamboo  
and likewise at the heart  
of who and what we are
