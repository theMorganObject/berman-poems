after a story told by Johnny Moses

She thought it had to be a bear  
raking the bushes  
near where she herself was picking  
berries just starting to fill  
her basket so she sang  
to keep her courage up  
and as the rustling sounds  
the creature made  
came closer  
so her singing rose  
higher and higher  
till at last  
rounding a bush  
she saw what she had feared  
and screamed Suyápi!  
Upside Down Face!  
not a bear  
a man of sorts  
but unlike any she had known  
his shiny pate quite hairless  
while a mass  
of hair hung down  
below his chin  
and so suyápi  
upsidedownface  
came to be the name for us anglos
among the Kootenai  
her people  
as if honoring that moment  
of first contact
