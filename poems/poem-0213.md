Mid-March  
sunshine and showers  
compete to see  
which of the two  
will carry the day's match  
the roses  
only starting to leaf out  
are undecided  
so all bets are off  
the dogs are waiting  
for their morning stroll  
I'm voting for  
an hour of sun or overcast  
then let it rain all afternoon  
there's work  
to do inside and poems  
still to write
