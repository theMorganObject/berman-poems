An hour of digging  
out along the garden fence  
forcing my spade  
through sandy clay  
making holes deep  
and wide enough to give  
our precious blueberries  
the space they'll need  
and all this time my eyes  
fixed on the dirt  
until I felt  
the evening chill come on  
and paused a moment  
to look up  
and there above me  
saw a hundred clouds  
catching the day's last light  
like waves breaking for miles  
along a spindrift shore  
and far out  
as if in a storm  
it stopped my breath  
that moment while  
the vision lasted  
then the clouds turned grey  
and I put down my spade  
and headed back indoors
