Mid-March  
the creekside willows  
sport the latest crop  
of catkins  
pussies stippled  
with yellow pollen  
although some by now  
have turned to silver grey

They look  
for all the world  
like furry caterpillers  
clinging to the thinnest  
branch tips  
glowing in the sunlight  
bright against the dark blue  
of the sky seen  
through the web  
of overarching alders

The way they catch  
the light makes haloed  
angels of the willows  
fairy spirits charged with watching  
over the spring creek  
and over us folk  
who are only  
passing by
