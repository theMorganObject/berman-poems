Tonight I slipped up  
once again - nothing new  
failed to show as promised  
for a friend  
who had asked me  
to join the online party  
for his 80th birthday  
no little number  
especially for someone  
like him with health issues  
living week to week  
an hour past the time  
I remembered  
and called  
to say just how sorry  
I was  
and I am  
and now in the aftermath  
I'm feeling the weight  
of my lifelong distractedness  
perennial forgetfulness  
words I'd give a lot  
to be able to banish  
but the failings they point to  
cling to me like leeches  
that steal and have stolen  
so much from my work  
from my friendships  
my family  
the women I've partnered with  
the wife I adore  
and who says I'm still worth it  
though I know she'd be happier  
if I'd simply remember  
the little things I said I'd do  
to slow the spread of chaos  
that follows in my wake  
just remember to breathe  
and look back behind you  
I tell myself whenever  
I'm not too distracted  
to think beyond the impulse  
that drives me to keep moving  
always moving  
from one thing to the next
