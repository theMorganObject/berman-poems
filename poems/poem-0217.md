I never boarded one  
but as a child  
I thought the boats  
were beautiful  
with their long bowsprit  
where the harpooner  
would stand far out in front  
waiting for the right moment  
to pitch his shaft  
with its barbed iron tip  
what seemed exciting as a child  
seems cruel now  
but I remember how I loved the taste  
of swordfish steaks  
grilled over charcoal  
a rare summer treat  
and the swords we nailed up  
on the wall after they'd dried  
the fleet was largely lost in '54  
when Carol blew up from the Gulf  
raised such a tide  
that even good sized boats  
were floated up  
over the docks and into town  
or else set down on pilings  
that broke through the hulls  
a few years later  
the big fish were gone  
from coastal waters  
and the fishermen  
found other stock  
and other ways to fish  
now thanks to regulation  
swordfish are back in numbers  
and there's talk  
of bringing back the old traditions  
but if it were up to me  
I'd cast my vote for rod and reel  
giving the fish  
at least a fighting chance
