What are the odds  
of being born human  
when beetles outnumber us  
a quadrillian to one  
was it just luck?  
did we do something virtuous  
in a past life  
as a fish or a snail?  
the word universe  
means it's one time around  
then back where we came from  
that must be the stars  
since the atoms  
our bodies are made of  
were forged in the stellar convulsions  
we call supernovae  
explosions that mark  
the last act of a star

If ever I'm blessed to be  
reborn a star  
in some farflung galaxy  
spinning in space  
may it be with a circling  
of jewel-like planets  
and may one at least  
appear pale blue and white  
and be teeming with life  
like this precious puffball  
of spacerock and water  
we've come to call earth  
our planet our mother  
for now but we know  
that all things are in motion  
and one day we too will be  
saying our goodbyes  
before moving on
