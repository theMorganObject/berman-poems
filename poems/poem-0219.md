Today the wind blew  
steady from the north  
chilling the valley floor  
dusting the hills  
with a thin sprinkling of snow  
not much but still enough  
to dazzle when the sun  
slid from behind the clouds  
and in a flash  
the hills that wind around  
our little town  
came into sharper focus  
and seemed suddenly  
imposing in a way  
you'd never seen before  
it was as if the air itself  
turned crystalline  
refracting sky and clouds  
bringing things closer  
giving depth  
and meaning to the day  
as when you look  
into the eyes of someone  
you thought you knew  
and see for the first time  
the hidden angel  
looking back at you  
smiling at your surprise
