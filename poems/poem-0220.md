Polkas polskas polonesses  
how many lives were lost  
in the Polish campaigns  
three centuries ago  
with nothing much to show  
for all that death and wounding  
save for the dances  
the tunes still kept alive  
by Swedish fiddlers  
catchy rythms the survivors  
brought back together with  
a distaste for foreign wars  
two things  
that might have been accomplished  
without all the blood shed
