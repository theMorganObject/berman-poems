for my wife and master gardener Carroll

Aptly named  
after the river nymph  
who spurned the hot Apollo  
choosing chastity  
and winning it  
at no small price  
by metamorphosing  
into the laurel tree  
a tale Ovid relates  
with his practiced aplomb

like a chaste maiden  
holds herself back  
from opening fully  
starts to bloom here  
while March nights  
still tend toward freezing  
her fragrance  
though delicate  
penetrates far  
as noted by the poet  
Yang Wanli who wrote  
of how the odor drifting  
through an open window  
woke the Daoist sage Lao Tzu  
from a deep sleep  
and sweeter dreaming  
a scene that I prefer  
to Ovid's amorous pursuit

But its the tender feelings  
my wife holds  
for her beloved daphnes  
that move me to admire  
the oval leaves  
the pale pink flowers  
the way the branches form  
a balanced harmony  
and then of course  
the unsurpassed deliciousness  
the blossoms spread abroad  
once they've agreed  
to open
