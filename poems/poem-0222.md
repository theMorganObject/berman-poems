When I dreamed  
that my left hand had withered  
and the doctors were all  
eager to amputate  
in my sleep I shouted no!  
and woke and then  
I knew for sure  
that change was overdue  
I saw the plane trees  
lining the broad walk  
up onto campus  
how the tender shoots  
had been pruned back  
until the branches  
looked like knobbly stumps  
and thought you see  
that's where this path  
is taking you  
and put that thought together  
with my dream  
and cried awhile  
and stepped away  
into my life
