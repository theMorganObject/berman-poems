All day the wind has been pushing  
to bring on the promised rain  
but the clouds keep slipping  
past and the sun  
keeps finding holes  
to poke through it's  
as if the elements were playing  
hide and seek or tag  
or some military game  
but this is not a complaint  
after all  
what can one expect  
from a month sandwiched  
between spring and winter  
with the Roman god of war  
invoked by his very name?
