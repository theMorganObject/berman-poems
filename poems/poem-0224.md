Dead beat after a day  
of digging  
lifting heavy shovelfulls  
of pungent horse manure  
and stuffing rose  
and holly clippings deep  
into the yardwaste bin  
now with the still of evening  
settling in to do this other work  
I find myself  
staring at words that  
show up as if on their own  
across the laptop screen  
the mind keeps drifting  
eyes refuse to stay propped open  
and the part of me that  
generally does an OK job  
pretending to be present  
and awake keeps nodding off  
so it's quite obvious  
there's no way any self-respecting  
poem would choose to leave its hiding  
place or even poke its head out  
like the providential groundhog  
to evaluate the weather  
before turning tail and heading  
back inside
