And they said to him "was there a lack of graves in Egypt, that you took us away to die in the wilderness"Â  Exodus 14:11

Once you've seen it for yourself  
the desert with it's bewildering profusion  
of choices  
possible directions  
freedoms and responsibilities  
then Egypt starts looking good  
even if it means  
working for the man  
hey Moses  
what were you thinking  
bringing us all the way  
out here to die?
