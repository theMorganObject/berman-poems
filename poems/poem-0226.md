If only it were this easy  
scoring a second shot  
at what we missed  
and always miss  
first time around  
if it were just a question  
of downing one more whisky  
or as simple as the second  
vaccination I received today  
a welcome milestone  
in this year of Covid deaths  
but it seems  
now that I've reached the age  
when at long last  
I have the beast caught  
clearly in the crosshairs  
all my cartridges are spent  
the chamber empty  
there's no drive left in me  
for bringing down the creature  
that I was forever seeking  
and that forever managed  
to elude me  
now best put down the gun  
forget that second shot  
the first one missed by miles  
so let me sit  
on this high bluff  
facing the trees  
and wait to see  
what walks out of the woods  
to meet me
