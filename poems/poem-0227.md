Ah Atahualpa  
what a gift of song you left us  
what words you found to lift those  
gaucho rythms  
baguala, chacarera, carnevalito  
milonga, cueca, zamba argentina  
you sang of solitude and distances  
of your own griefs and those  
of the indigenas  
but also of their loves and of your own  
and of the lives of simple folk  
who dwell close to the earth  
you urged a reverence  
for the ancestors now become  
one with the wheatfields  
with the stones  
lining the river bank  
you sang the mountains  
with their rushing streams  
calling us back  
to who and what we are  
when we are true  
to what is deepest in ourselves  
and now its nearly thirty years  
since you yourself  
were called back but your voice  
still reaches far beyond  
the valleys that you loved  
your melodies  
your way with the guitar  
the poetry with which  
you shared your vision  
of a world that few of us have known  
through your gifts  
became a deep reflection  
on all we humans share  
I like to think of you  
again on horseback  
guitar in hand  
singing as you ride  
the long trails of eternity
