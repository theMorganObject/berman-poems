One time I heard him live  
in San Francisco  
with my friend Juliette  
who'd introduced me  
to the world of viols  
he played Ortiz from the mid  
fifteen hundreds  
pieces I myself had tried  
the notes aren't hard  
but he made music happen  
such as I had not thought possible  
the Bach sonata too was flawless but  
it was the Astr√©e recording  
won my heart  
made in France forty-five years ago  
the church in  
dance suites from 1685 composed  
by the a viol player known only as  
Sieur de Machy  
Savall performed them on an instrument  
from de Machy's time  
the sound on the LP is indescribable  
rich, deep, melancholy, lyrical  
evocative of a world  
distant from ours  
not just by centuries  
but by its sensual delicacy  
intensity expressed  
with a restraint  
that we have mostly lost  
these dance suites seem  
too intimate for dancing  
the bass strings  
reaching deeper than a cello  
as if to ground the upper voices  
in the earth  
the high notes plaintive  
trembling with pure feeling  
only a true master such as Savall was  
and is today as he approaches eighty  
with his Catalan and Spanish sensibilities  
could liberate the spirit hidden  
in this music from a another world  
and leave me an astonished listener
