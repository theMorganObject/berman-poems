It's written  
only God is good  
but I demur  
today a stranger  
showed up at our door  
handed me the wallet  
I'd had lost  
while walking in the park  
in it my driver's license  
credit cards,  
medical cards, cash  
he smiled and said that  
he was glad he'd found me  
and god bless  
and have a good weekend  
he scarcely gave me time  
to thank him or return  
the blessing he'd bestowed  
with all my heart  
I wish him every happiness  
he left me feeling  
better about living in a world  
where every day  
we hear so many stories  
of the harm we humans do  
to one another  
to our fellow creatures  
to the planet  
this man's honesty was a reminder  
of the goodness that surely is  
our truer nature  
it called to mind  
the ancient Russian proverb  
one spoonful of truth  
outweighs the world
