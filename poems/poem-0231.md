Resting on the couch  
in the quiet of our livingroom  
after a day  
of working in the yard  
I look up  
and through the bamboo curtains  
see the full moon  
pale and perfect  
rising slowly in a cloudless sky  
and I know it must be Passover  
the second of this Covid year  
the first I can remember  
spending alone  
with my sweet wife  
just the two of us  
and wholly unprepared  
no matzah no gefilte fish  
no blessings, family stories, songs  
no gathering of friends  
not even zooming with my sister  
back in Brooklyn  
like a year ago  
this year we're stuck  
waiting to see if Moses  
can again pull off the miracle  
and lead us stiff-necked people  
out of Egypt  
through the sea
