The ponderosa in our yard  
in Oregon  
has reached a height  
greater I think than any  
living tree in Massachusetts  
where in centuries past  
a climax forest grew  
until the British  
cut the taller trees for masts  
1660 was the year the Royal Navy  
came on board  
I think of China  
India, the Middle East  
of opium and oil  
African diamonds  
not that we Americans  
have much these days to boast of  
still I wonder  
how could one small island  
have compassed  
such a world of harm?
