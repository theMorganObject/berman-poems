Tonight the third night  
of counting the Omer  
when in kabbalah we invoke  
the heart of kindliness  
the kindliness of father Avraham  
the radiant heart of Yaakov his grandson  
my friend Hank  
who just last week turned eighty  
was telling me how he had learned to read  
sitting on his grandfather's lap  
his mother's father  
who had a shul in Philadelphia  
where he was cantor  
with a balcony for women  
but no rabbi  
"if anyone had anything to say  
they just stood up and said it"  
I suspect  
this "anyone" applied chiefly to men  
Hank was almost in tears remembering  
these moments of his childhood  
but forgot to say  
if it was Hebrew or English  
that his grandfather  
was teaching him to read
