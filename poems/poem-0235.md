For any non-musician or  
non-instrumentalist I think  
it would be difficult  
to grasp the heartfelt sense  
of coming home that rises  
when one steps into the shop  
where all appearances suggest  
that chaos reigns  
a plethora of parts  
of cellos  
violins, guitars and other  
more exotic musical inventions  
even harpsichords  
are strewn on benches  
hung from walls  
stashed in the attic  
seen in every stage  
of disrepair  
so that it takes an effort  
to imagine this the place  
where musical refinement  
harmony and order  
are made possible  
where broken bows  
are lovingly  
made whole again  
where knowledge of hide glues  
viol strings and honeyed lacquers  
plus a myriad tricks that make  
the craft of violin repair  
truly an art  
as practiced by our friend and mentor  
Stephen Bacon  
who with generosity  
and patience  
has pursued his craft  
here in this shop  
for nearly forty years
