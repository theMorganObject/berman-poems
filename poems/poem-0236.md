Cellists and violinists know  
beyond a doubt  
that for tonal richness  
warmth and ease of playing  
one's bow requires  
a certain springiness  
same with our minds  
and bodies I imagine  
another reason  
to make time for stretching  
if you're stiff  
and if you're heavy  
to let go of excess weight  
whether emotional  
or physical or both  
so as to ease up  
on the instrument  
letting the music  
flow effortlessly  
or appear to do so  
also it helps if one remembers  
to leave space for the silences  
that hide  
in and around the notes  
the melodies may move you  
but in the end the silences  
are what it's all about
