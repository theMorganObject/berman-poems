On the windowsill  
above the stuffed beige chair  
the clustered flowers seem to spring  
from their glass vase  
as if alive  
a rich array of vibrant colors  
pinks and purples  
whites and yellows  
and the globe thistle's pale grey  
all so lovingly arranged  
by my dear wife  
that though she's sleeping  
in our bed upstairs  
her presence here beside me  
in this room  
is as real to me  
as anything I've known
