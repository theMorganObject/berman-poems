Easter Bunny

My friend writes  
if the Easter bunny  
sees his shadow  
ducks back in his hole  
it means we better be ready  
for three more weeks of Lent  
with friends like that  
we might just make it through  
this year of plague  
with all or mostly all  
our wits intact

Easter Thoughts

It's clear that Jesus  
was no ordinary rabbi  
though it's unlikely he intended  
the uses others made of him  
if the gospel that's attributed to Thomas  
had prevailed  
how differently the world  
would have come to know the son of man  
who speaking of God's Kingdom  
said "if it were in Heaven  
the birds would get there first!"  
who told his students  
"do not call me master!  
we are no different now that you and I  
drink from the same wellspring"  
who must have smiled  
while tossing riddles to his students  
the kingdom that you seek is here  
before your eyes  
if only you would open them  
with such a teacher  
no need for miracles  
other than those  
that make up every moment  
of our lives  
in this God's miracle  
we call the universe
