Are they worth it  
the roses?  
maybe the Chinese  
were right to prefer peonies  
bigger blossoms  
and without the thorns  
today again my arm bled  
simply from tending  
an irritable rose  
it felt so undeserved  
I was only trying  
to help it grow  
it's like when Ollie  
our beloved cat  
gets tired of being stroked  
and without warning  
digs in his claws  
just so you know  
I'm not sure if vigilance  
can safeguard liberty  
but it does seem a good plan  
for rose enthusiasts  
cat lovers  
and husbands wishing to maintain  
a peaceful status quo
