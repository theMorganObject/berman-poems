Last night or was it  
in this morning's slumber  
the girlfriend who broke my heart  
fifty-five years ago  
came for a visit  
an older woman now  
with her grandson  
she told me she had turned  
seventy-five  
looking at her I still saw  
a radiant being  
a goddess if you will  
such beaty in her face  
her form  
her eyes  
her visit brought  
a sense of deep delight  
I told her these past years  
have been the happiest  
I can remember  
thanks to the sweet wife  
I find so easy to adore  
the one who sees me  
sees my every flaw  
and loves me still  
but she is such a perfectionist!  
my former love declared  
why do you think that?  
I asked but at that point  
I lost the thread  
something about the visiting grandson  
making a mess  
and my wife loosing it  
over-reacting  
when I woke up I told my wife  
and we both laughed  
the story of my wife's perfectionism  
being nothing new to either of us  
but the dream meant more to me  
than just the laughter  
or the words that passed between  
us two dream figures  
all day I've felt elated and refreshed  
as if the glow of adolescent love  
were still alive in me  
surfacing now  
a gift of my old age
