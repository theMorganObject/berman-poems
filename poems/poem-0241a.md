My grandfather professed  
to have seen angels  
and kept a shelf of books  
on UFOs  
like him  
like most of us  
I have a feeling  
there's more to this  
than any of us knows

But when it comes to  
aliens or angels  
I'm happy to be ever  
in the dark  
as Hobbes once said to Calvin  
the best evidence  
for creatures with intelligence  
like ours  
is that they've kept their presence  
hidden  
safe beyond the drifting stars
