Sweet Mountains - Ye tell Me no lie -  
 Never deny Me - Never fly -

She must have had the psalm in mind  
Esa enai - I lift my eyes unto the hills  
whence comes my help  
but what lie is it that her mountains  
unlike us mortals  
can be trusted not to speak?

What seems clear  
is that she felt the hills  
her strong Madonnas  
as she called them  
no mere metaphor  
rather a living presence  
whose "unvarying eyes"  
returned her gaze  
with truth and constancy
