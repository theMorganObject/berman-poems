Once he'd finished executing  
a sort of aural archeology  
excavating the thick surface layers  
to arrive at last at the occluded eardrum  
the friendly tech  
impressed by the sheer quantity  
of wax suggested I might want  
to weigh myself again  
I said my wife  
had sent me down  
to see if it would help my hearing  
his comment  
now you have no more excuses
