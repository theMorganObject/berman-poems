    				after a telling by Clara Pearson
    					Nehalem Tillamook

As time passed the man tired  
of his seal wives  
the sisters who had rescued him  
from drowning  
when his canoe capsized

Missing his former life  
he fled back to his village  
to his daughter  
and the wife who recognized him  
though he'd changed  
grown fur on his face and arms  
still she took him back

For days he sang the songs he'd learned  
from the seal people  
now he was fearful of the water  
and only once reluctantly agreed  
to go with his wife's brothers  
fishing with nets from their canoe

When the nets snagged  
and the brothers  
failed to free them  
he looked below and saw  
his two seal wives  
even then the brothers  
badgered him  
till he jumped overboard  
it was as he had seen  
his two seal wives  
were clinging to the nets  
waiting for him  
because those brothers wished it  
he went back  
to live with his seal wives
