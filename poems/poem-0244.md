after Clara Pearson's telling

Southwind had a wife  
but still fell hard  
for the young woman  
he saw sitting by herself  
always by herself  
down by the shore  
she was Ocean's daughter  
chief of chiefs  
and she was beautiful

He wanted her  
but every time  
she slipped away  
until his aunt Blue Jay  
gave him advice  
don't blink she said  
just fix her in your sight  
till you catch hold  
he followed that advice  
and brought her home

She was used to sleeping  
in a softer bed  
than Southwind could provide  
she wasn't happy  
and didn't keep it  
secret from her husband

After a while he thought  
to bring her back  
to her old place  
to spend time at the lodge  
of her richly appointed father  
and she was happy once again

Now Southwind spoke  
with his father-in-law  
I will travel swiftly  
breaking things  
and sending them your way  
and you will do your part  
to drift and drown things  
from now on we two  
will always work together

Southwind's first wife was jealous  
more than once  
she packed up her belongings  
tried to leave  
but however far she travelled  
she could not escape  
he always found her  
in some corner of the house  
and no wonder  
the whole world  
was Southwind's house!
