after the telling of Clara Pearson  
 Nehalem Tillamook

She couldn't reach those tasty crabapples  
that hung high in the tree  
just out of reach  
she thought  
if only Bear would come  
and pick them for me

The young man who appeared  
wearing a bearskin  
and dentalium shell earrings  
said only  
why are you afraid?  
you wished for me to come

He climbed the tree  
dropped the crabapples down  
till she had a full basket  
are you ready to come home?  
he asked  
if so, come with me

She did as she was told  
and followed him  
he circled round to make it  
seem a long ways off  
his home was in a hollow tree  
but still  
she stayed with him

Soon she was pregnant  
her first child was a girl  
human like her  
the second child a male  
a bear cub  
the image of his father

Her brothers hunted sea lions  
from their canoes  
her husband said he would  
go out with them  
and bring her back sea lion meat  
for all she ate  
was skunk cabbage  
he promised this  
but it was all a lie

One day her daughter  
caught a frog  
thinking to give it  
as a plaything  
to her baby brother  
but father bear said no  
he is afraid of it  
then her mother said  
go throw it  
on your father's back  
it's he who is afraid  
at this the bear husband  
took up his son  
and ran off never looking back

When he did not return  
the mother said  
let's see if we  
can find my brothers  
at the shore  
she reckoned by the sun  
and soon she found them  
to her surprise  
no great distance away

The brothers were amazed  
where were you sister?  
we thought you must be dead!  
I went with Bear  
and he became my husband  
we had two children  
our son a bear like him  
and this our daughter  
now that he's left me  
there's nothing more to say
