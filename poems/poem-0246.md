Today it was the apple tree  
that kept me busy  
standing on a ladder  
pruning back the water sprouts  
that grew straight up  
as if they wished  
to reach the sky

Though April nights are cold  
in the Cascades  
the apple blossoms  
fully opened  
celebrate the spring  
with their display  
of clustered flowers  
pink and white  
and softly glowing  
in the sunlight  
sweetly fragrant  
when I bring them  
to my nose

This year we plan to spray  
for coddling moths  
hoping to gain a better harvest  
it's still months away  
but in my mind  
I see the branches  
bending from the weight  
of perfect yellow fruit

Some scholars say the fruit  
with which Eve tempted Adam  
was a fig or possibly  
a pomegranite  
but I'll stick with apples  
as the Song of Songs  
urges so sweetly  
"comfort me with apples  
for I'm sick with love"
