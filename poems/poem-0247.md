Time was I thought I knew  
a thing or two but now  
my head's a hollow gourd  
an old man's noggin  
full of nonsense  
whispy thoughts  
a jumbled heap of memories  
not quite the quiet mind of clover  
that Aiken roshi spoke about  
rather a cloud blown  
here and there  
at the wind's mercy  
while some days a silly song  
will buzz for hours  
in my ear  
to no purpose I can discern  
but just over a year ago  
while walking in the graveyard  
of a country town  
I heard the evening grosbeaks  
calling out alive! alive! alive!
