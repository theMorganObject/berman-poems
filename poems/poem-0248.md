Fighting their way  
five hundred miles upstream  
living on the fat  
they'd carried with them  
from the Pacific  
these Chinook were resting  
splashing in the shallows  
of the Imnaha  
having left the Snake  
and the Columbia  
behind them and completed  
their long journey of return

As we watched them  
bodies dark in the clear water  
dancing their final dance  
the precious eggs  
safe in the redds  
formed in the gravel  
by the females  
we could only feel enlivend  
by the presence  
of something older  
wiser than ourselves

from their thousand mile pilgrimage  
up the Columbia into the Snake  
and then up this narrower stream  
the Imnaha  
these Chinook  
were here to make their redds  
down in the gravel pools
