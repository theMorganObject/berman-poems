These days it's gotten even harder  
to know if I'm awake  
or only dreaming  
perhaps because spring's onrush  
is so dreamlike  
the landscape changing  
every time I breathe  
new leaves and flowers  
appearing out of nowhere  
almost unearthly beauty  
all around me  
or is it that my dreams  
have grown more serious  
more focused on their task  
and so more lifelike  
working to prepare me  
for that vital moment  
of waking from this dream  
into the next
