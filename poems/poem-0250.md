They sang for me  
the couple sharing my compartment  
a balled from the 19th century  
don't stir up old memories  
the lyrics went  
they'll only reawaken bygone griefs  
ah the suffering that seems so dear  
so essential to the Russian soul!

I was eighteen  
you're just a child she told me  
this Russian beauty in her mid-twenties  
and she was right  
her Uzbek lover sang  
with a high tenor voice and sweet  
they slept together in the bunk  
above me

That morning  
as we pulled into the station  
in near darkness  
a fellow student peering  
through the steamy glass  
exclaimed Sankt Petersburg!  
words that in time  
would prove prophetic

Back in Moscow  
after the concert and my debut  
on Soviet TV  
none too convincing  
I was invited  
to her apartment for a party  
the occasion was  
her husband's birthday

the Uzbek singer too  
was in attendance  
in the kitchen cooking up pilaf  
the War I thought the War  
back in America it seemed so distant  
here in Russia still so recent  
so disruptive of the fragile ties  
that hold our world together

February 1961  
the overnight express  
Moscow to Leningrad  
I was eighteen  
the couple sharing my compartment  
would sing together  
in our upcoming performance  
the young man Uzbek  
a sweet tenor voice  
she in my youthful eyes  
a classic beauty  
out of a tale by Chekhov  
they sang for me  
in harmony a ballad  
don't stir up memories  
of bygone days  
the lyrics said  
they'll only reawaken  
the old griefs  
ah the suffering  
so dear to the Russian soul

She was I think somewhere  
in her mid twenties  
told me I was just a child  
and she was right  
they slept together  
in the bunk above me

In the morning a companion  
and fellow student  
on this musical excursion  
gazed through the window  
while in near darkness  
we pulled into the station  
Sankt Petersburg  
he said with reverence  
I thought for Russia's past  
and as  
also prophetically
