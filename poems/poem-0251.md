Who is this woman  
dressed in white folks clothes  
and staring from the cover  
of a book of native tales?  
not the gifted storyteller  
the one whose words give us the text  
but an elder from the Clatsop tribe  
wife of Chief Illga - Tsetseno  
Nehalem Tillamook

The book notes give her name  
as Maggie Illga though  
her husband would have known her  
as Koshtewah  
born in 1800  
lived a hundred years  
a hundred years!

The photo  
taken late in life  
is striking for the wide awake  
expressive eyes that look  
with equal parts of sorrow  
and outrage  
as if to lay her losses  
at the feet  
of the poor cameraman  
as if his camera shot were one more  
deeply felt indignity

Yet it's no candid shot  
it seems to catch  
either her fixed expression  
or a gesture meant to say exactly  
what it says  
I see you  
you destroyers of a world  
that in the time before you came  
was whole  
a world that when  
I was a girl  
I knew and loved
