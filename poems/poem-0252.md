When it comes to wild onions  
I'm a cautious soul  
remembering Coyote  
how he couldn't stop  
eating them and drowned  
in his own shit  
but these beauties  
their progenitors  
a gift from my wife's sister  
dug up in our yard  
rinsed in the sink  
chopped down to size  
their roots snipped off  
have joined baby potatoes  
and sliced mushrooms  
plus a bit of chicken bouillon  
for the salting  
and now have disappeared  
into the broth  
imparting such a sweetness  
that my wife  
admits the soup might be  
as good as hers  
sorry Coyote  
couldn't bring myself  
to share your fate  
you know I've never had  
your gift for bouncing back  
from such calamities  
as you bring on yourself  
though I confess  
there's times when I too  
have been caught  
with my pants down  
but like I said  
with wild onions  
I'm a cautious soul
