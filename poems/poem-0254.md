There was as always  
a brief moment of startle  
seeing the movement even before  
the animal itself  
like so many small wonders  
here on planet earth  
this fellow if less common  
would be thought  
a creature of great beauty  
named for the slender band  
that women used  
and some still do  
to keep their stockings  
safe from falling down  
a name suggestive of  
the single stripe  
often yellow but this time  
pale orange running  
down the center of its back  
I was tempted to pick up  
the pretty thing  
to feel the smoothness  
of its belly scales  
but resisted  
wishing it to feel safe  
in our garden  
and if a female  
hoping she would stay on  
find a mate  
have babies  
but for me  
simply to have enjoyed  
this brief and unexpected visit  
lifted my spirits and confirmed  
my sense that spring was now  
fully arrived
