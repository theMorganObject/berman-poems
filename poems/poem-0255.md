What a delight  
my younger brother John  
or João as he is known  
in his adopted country  
now that he's seventy  
and I'm coming up  
on seventy-eight  
we're closer than we've ever been  
and that despite  
his living in another world  
four time zones to the east  
and that's the least of it  
with me a small town boy  
choosing to roost  
in what he calls the boondocks  
while he's comfortable  
cooped up in the world's  
seventh largest city  
São Paolo  
with dear Lili his Brazilian wife  
still what we share  
the family memories  
places weve been together  
our lives as husbands  
fathers, grandfathers  
the light-hearted humor  
we both treasure  
and that he excells in  
and finally the choice  
that we two made  
despite a father's disappointment  
to create  
a life in music  
with its challenges and gifts  
now thanks to Facetime  
Skype and social media  
we meet across six thousand  
and some miles  
as if only a block or two away  
and laugh about this crazy-making world  
and talk of trips  
places we'd like to visit  
with our wives  
and where we might meet up  
travel together  
places that beckon  
like Portugal
