Sometimes it feels as if there's nothing  
more to say  
nothing new under the sun  
it's all been said  
a thousand times and in  
a thousand ways  
so why again this wrestling  
with words  
this effort to extract  
some novel insight  
or make music  
that falls fresh on jaded ears  
then I remember how the morning sunlight  
flooded the garden  
set the still unfolding  
blossoms of the yellow rose aglow  
and words to speak the beauty  
of this vision  
rise in my mind  
asking to find a place  
where they can live  
like notes played on a flute  
a captured melody  
echoing the life unfolding  
like the rose  
moment to moment  
forever new
