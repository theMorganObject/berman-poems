after Lushootseed storyteller Martha Lamont

Back then  
when all the animals were people  
Crow counted herself fancyfolk  
and far too fine  
even to consider such hopefuls  
as Raccoon  
Bufflehead or Mallard  
Bear or Deer  
she had only  
words of scorn to heap on them  
little paint-up face  
she called Raccoon

To marry one of her own  
rank and wealth  
that is where her seagull slaves  
are taking her  
a troop of chatterers  
they set her down  
in her canoe  
laden with dainties  
herring and smelt  
for the upcoming feast

Her mind is fixed on Shell  
whose wealth is evident  
see how he glitters  
in his iridescent clothes  
yes he's the one  
a willing groom  
look how he's laid  
a path of priceless blankets  
from the water's edge  
up to his parents' house  
above the shore  
a bridal path to where  
the wedding will take place  
where he and she will sing  
together dance together  
as if in trance around the fire  
until they're wed  
and tired guests can head  
for home at last
