When I was two  
my father came back from the war  
in Europe and he sang to me  
a Russian lullaby  
he'd learned toward the war's end  
when he began  
to study Russian  
I've no memory of this  
but find it easy  
to believe the family story  
now he's been nearly  
fourteen years in heaven  
leaving me to think  
about the many ways  
we failed eachother  
how I might better  
have returned his love  
have made an honest effort  
to reach out  
and meet him in the places  
where understanding still  
was possible  
fathers and sons  
it's an old old story  
with enough variations  
to fill libraries  
the lullaby by Lermontov  
speaks of battle  
and a mother's pride and grief  
when sons go off  
to war  
the army, son, will make a man  
of you he told me  
this during Vietnam  
and I like Ferdinand  
the bull who preferred meadow flowers  
to the bullring  
but I miss him  
more than I'm ever likely to admit
