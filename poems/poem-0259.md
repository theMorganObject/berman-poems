Water droplets falling  
through the air above the fountain  
make soft music as they strike  
the surface of the pond  
it's a sound that changes  
everything about the day  
the garden  
an echo of the creeks that flow  
down from the nearby hills  
and singing  
make their way through town

Now our little pond  
has joined the springtime revels  
with its water music  
background for the talk  
of nesting jays  
soon the frogs will add  
their shrill voices to the chorus  
filling the night air  
with their sweet noise
