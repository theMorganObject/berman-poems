She seems a tiny thing  
for such a voyage  
was my thought  
the day I came on board  
the replica out of Grays Harbor  
how could they  
have sailed her round the Horn  
and through Magellen Strait

Her captain Robert Gray was clearly  
made of sterner stuff  
than most men then or now  
cruising the coast  
to what would would soon become  
the states of Oregon  
and Washington  
he was the first non-native  
to discover the river  
he named for his second ship  
Columbia  
Rediviva that was 1792  
before the expedition overland  
of Lewis and Clark  
so Woody's song  
rings with a cadence  
that evokes the river's power  
roll on Columbia  
roll on

My friend Jim Rich crewed  
with the Lady Washington  
the replica that is  
taught the old chanties  
to school children  
who came on board  
and afterwards  
gained a ship captain's license  
now he too like Gray  
is sailing other seas than ours
