from the Dine Bahane (Navaho)

After Coyote had conjured up the rain  
so he could stand there  
at the entrance to her hogan  
while her brothers were away  
bedraggled pitiful  
to plead for refuge  
over by the wall  
then after a while  
down by the foot  
of the bed  
and then beneath  
a corner of the blanket  
he was so cold!  
then inching ever closer  
till by morning  
they were husband and wife

They had to flee  
her brothers had no use for such  
an evil smelling inlaw  
so it was time now  
for these two newlyweds  
to work out for themselves  
the rules of marriage

You get four chances  
Coyote informed her  
(note the sacred number)  
to destroy me  
then it will be my turn  
and so four times  
she burned his body  
ground his bones  
till they were dust  
and scattered the dust  
far across the desert  
on the night wind

Each time she waited  
hoping beyond hope  
he'd make it back  
and each time he did  
he was Coyote!  
now it was his turn  
and he returned the favor  
ground her bones  
sent the dust flying  
and like her  
was happy when she found her way  
back to him  
in this way was marriage instituted  
by Coyote and his wife  
in those first days
