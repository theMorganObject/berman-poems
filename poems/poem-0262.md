Vineyard Haven summer of '57

Out at the far end of the pier  
we'd sit for hours  
in the semi-dark  
with flickering lamplight  
making the water surface sparkle  
as it sloshed  
against the pilings down below  
long summer nights  
tasting the salt air  
smelling the creosote  
while the whole dock  
creaked with the tidal flow  
we'd cut the squid  
in strips to bait our droplines  
and wait to feel the tug  
that meant a conger eel  
was on the hook

Saving our catch  
not for ourselves but for Manuel  
old Portugee who knew how  
to prepare them  
it was just the simple joy  
of being there  
away from any challenges  
the world might have in store  
for carefree boys of summer  
we had no way  
to know how fortunate we were  
to have that freedom  
or how soon the signs  
No Loitering on the Dock  
No Fishing would appear  
as the world closed in on itself
