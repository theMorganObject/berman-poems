a subtle fish  
by any estimation  
in point of fact  
no fish at all  
a most unique creation  
eight arms  
ten feet  
a decapod  
a mollusc highly clever  
as far from snails  
as heads from tails  
thus scientists endeavor  
to understand  
what constitutes  
a cuttlefish's mind  
while they  
the cuttlefish appear  
to contemplate our kind  
as well  
at least when some of us  
engage them in their world  
they may reach out  
to taste us  
with a cautious arm uncurled  
but what the cuttlefish  
has raised  
to heights beyond believing  
the art of changing  
colors for display  
or for achieving  
a miracle of camouflage  
or simply for the pleasure  
we'll never really know  
the mind or fully  
take the measure  
of this cousin  
from a distant branch  
of evolution's tree  
it's been an age  
or more since we two  
parted company
