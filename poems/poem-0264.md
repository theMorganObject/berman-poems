Was there something in the tea  
that he kept serving?  
after the fifth or sixth cup  
I lost count  
too taken with the treasures  
he had gathered  
in the villages of eastern Turkey  
bridal trousseaus  
weavings from eighty or a hundred  
years before  
family heirlooms  
bought on the cheap  
from country folk  
who grandparents had worked  
the wool with natural dyes  
the faded colors  
shone in the shop's light  
with a soft  
almost unearthly glow  
the tea was having its effect  
as well

The rugs that hung  
pulsing with color  
on the walls  
were unlike any that  
I'd seen before  
works of folk art  
carefree in their lack  
of deference to symmetry  
not perfect  
like the factory-made carpets  
but alive  
and rich with vibrant colots  
and designs  
that spoke the love  
the weavers stitched  
into the fabric  
working not for money  
but to bring  
something of themselves  
their art and spirit  
into the home

Now they were hanging  
in a shop in Selçuk  
where a foreigner  
like me  
could take a credit card  
out of his pocket  
and walk off with a piece  
of someone's history  
their family's heritage  
much like the quilt made  
by my wife's great-grandmother  
bequeathed to her offspring  
and which now holds  
 a place of pride  
up on our bedroom wall

So I pray the reverence  
with which I treasure  
the two rugs that I chose  
may someway serve  
to compensate the loss  
their presence  
here in our home in Oregon  
betokens
