Too late in the game  
to change my life  
to something that my parents  
might have spoken of  
with pride and anyway  
they're both beyond  
such fripperies  
busy exploring  
I would hope  
quite other worlds  
than those already known  
to us cave dwellers  
we who are enchanted still  
by shadows  
flickering along the wall  
we see  
as John would have it  
but a dark reflection

Yet for all we fail to open  
these blindfolded eyes  
the spring's exhuberance  
breaks through our best defences  
just this week the onslaught  
of madrone blossoms  
caught us by surprise  
all over town and on  
the hills above  
pale waxen clusters  
dropped their load  
littered the ground with pearls  
perfumed the night air  
with their overpowering sweetness

Like the magician  
that she is  
this month of April  
has been pulling from her hat  
surprises one after another  
so much more  
than we could choose  
to brush aside or hide from  
blossoms, colors, fragrances  
squirrels chattering  
birds courting it's  
a show that brings  
to mind the songs  
we learned when we  
were young and new to love  
and blood pulsed madly  
through our veins  
with every spring's arrival  
seems that some things  
though not many  
scarcely change
