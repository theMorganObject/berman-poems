from the bottom of a lake  
these words  
empty of self  
and of significance  
burst in the evening air  
and dissipate  
while I bemused sit back  
letting my fingers  
choose for me which keys to push  
and watch  
with only mild surprise as words  
appear like notes of music  
on the page

I tell myself not every poem  
needs to touch  
life's nerves or dredge up  
from some hidden depth  
a novel creature  
or a treasure lost  
when galleons went down  
centuries past  
some songs say nothing more  
than what the melody  
brings to the ear  
and often that's enough
