First to thank you  
for the music of your words  
the lines that flow  
effortlessly with all the richness  
of the Russian vowels and  
liquid consonants  
more Italian  
than our German gutterals

And then for giving us  
the Russian weather  
December thaws  
and February days  
with dripping icycles  
like nature's tears  
the mud of spring  
the summer fields of flowers  
skies that glower  
with impending rain

And other kinds of weather  
more internal  
or personal  
suggestive of the century's  
intrusion on the lives  
of friends  
of loved ones  
on your generation  
ordinary folk  
caught up in history  
like your creation  
the good Doctor Zhivago

And finally to say how  
through the years  
I've taken heart from words you wrote  
reminding artists  
writers, poets  
never to lose sight  
of what the work  
is finally about  
that even while imprisoned  
so to speak  
in time and history  
to work at making  
something of beauty  
is to act on heaven's behalf  
to be an envoy of eternity
