The sunset light is  
 lovely beyond limit  
 only it brings close  
 the coming dark

Li Shangyin wrote it  
 succinctly and well  
twenty short words  
 tell of an evening's outing  
the sun's last rays  
 turning the hills to gold  
a moment of pure ecstacy  
 and then  
the thought of just how soon  
 the darkness follows  
now that I harbor  
 my own sunset thoughts  
the poet's words  
 have found me where I live  
the light of these spring skies  
 all the more precious  
at evening when the sun  
 dapples the hills  
and catches clouds  
 that fade from pink to grey  
it's all that I can do  
 to catch my breath  
remembering the wonders  
 of the day
