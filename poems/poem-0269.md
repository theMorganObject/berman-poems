Today I was thinking  
if my brother-in-law Ismail  
had not driven over  
a body in the street  
on a dark night in Izmir  
and he does drive too fast  
but may not have been the first  
would he have phoned my sister  
teaching Armenian children  
at a school in Moscow  
now the Russian Federation  
to say to her  
after so many years  
of hesitation on his part  
Susanna let's get married  
oh and by the way  
depending how my trial goes  
I may have to be  
in prison for a while
