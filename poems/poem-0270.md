My head is the apple  
 without ere a core  
 My mind is the house  
 without ere a door  
 English folksong - I will give my love an apple

A day of fixing  
garden hoses  
electric outlets  
irrigation lines and talking  
with the contractors  
about the failing  
decks the dry rot  
it's that kind of week  
no wonder just last night  
I dreamed of being trapped  
inside a house  
with many doors  
and none of them  
would open  
to the outside world

Though any Zen  
practitioner  
would say  
there is no mind  
no door  
no inside/outside  
yet as freely  
as these days  
my mind or is it  
no-mind wanders  
you would think  
I'd spend more time  
exploring as I did  
in childhood  
that magic world  
outside the house  
beyond the door
