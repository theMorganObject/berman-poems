What is it about islands  
that evokes in us such loyalty  
such love?  
is it the journeys  
that we undertake  
to reach them  
or the sense we have  
that each of us  
(sorry John Dunne)  
is in some way  
unto himself/herself  
an island  
so that we find in them  
a living intimation  
a reflection of our inner life  
our souls  
or is it  
as I like to think  
because they lie  
off at a distance  
that they gift us time apart  
from the world's hurly-burly  
take us back  
to when and where our lives  
were less frenetic  
less fraught with the day's  
endless exigencies  
or perhaps it's none of these  
but just the beauty  
we cannot fail to find  
when land is ringed  
by water on all sides  
whether a quiet lake  
or the unresting ocean
