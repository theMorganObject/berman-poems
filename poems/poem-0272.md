Dearest Linda  
Carroll tells me you and I  
would have been more than friends  
that you'd have found  
in me an older brother  
one who shared  
your intellectual passion  
your strong ways of engaging  
with others  
with the world  
and so I share in my wife's grief  
that we lost you  
far too soon  
who were her closest  
best companion  
through her childhood  
adolescence  
college years  
you were the one  
she left home with  
when you were twenty  
and she just eighteen  
for three years you two  
lived together  
sharing your dreams  
how deeply still  
she feels your loss  
twenty years later  
shows me how much  
she loved and treasured you  
and though I never had  
the chance to know you  
getting to know the daughter  
whom you left behind  
now a newly fledged pediatrician  
a woman of strong feelings and opinions  
that same intensity my Carroll says  
was your way too  
I can imagine something  
of who you were  
and for your sister will be always  
so I'm writing to invite you formally  
into our home  
whether as memory or spirit  
or whatever form  
you wish to take  
you're welcome here with us  
and I will love you and respect you  
as my wife does  
so she can move beyond mere grief  
to celebration of a life  
your life and to the understanding  
that your presence here with us  
if still a gift  
something to make us laugh at times  
or to surprise us  
when one of us  
blurts out a witticism  
or complaint that clearly came from you  
or else a memory  
that you've brought to mind  
for my wife  
your sister  
to share with me  
enough for now  
we can continue this  
another time  
since time is all we have  
that and our loves  
there's little else exists  
that's worth the worry
