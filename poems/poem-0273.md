In Girona  
there's little's left to show  
of the six centuries  
of Jewish life that ended  
so abruptly in 1492  
the ruins of the synagogue  
now a museum  
a research library  
since we Jews want to know  
about our ancestors  
and in the air  
of the old Jewish quarter  
some trace of Rabbi Moses  
son of Nachman  
learned kabbalist  
Girona's most illustrious  
defender of the faith  
but what I found most moving  
was the mikveh  
with its long low lintel  
and stone slabs  
that granted access  
to the pool  
some five feet deep  
where men and women  
always separately  
would enter to immerse  
and purify themselves  
now dimly lit  
it seemed to glow with a faint light  
less a reflection  
than an emanation of the stone itself  
as if the men and women  
who had bathed there  
had left behind an aura  
holy light  
I thought of Jacob's words  
after he woke  
from his prophetic dream  
saying how God  
is in this place  
and only now I see it
