How soon will we meet this child  
whose chosen so insistently  
to take up residence  
within our daughter's womb?

The first trimester over now  
without a hitch  
all looking good  
the soon-to-become parents  
have decided not to learn  
if she or he's a girl or boy

Having waited for what seemed  
to us a small eternity  
they are of course elated  
and we too are full of thoughts  
and plans of when  
and how to visit  
and will we be here  
to see her - or him - graduate  
from grade school  
high school  
college  
so we race ahead  
in our imaginations

It's just the eagerness we're feeling  
impatient for the joys  
we know will grace this birth  
this presence of a new love  
in our daughter's  
and her husband's life  
and in our lives  
a child, a grandchild  
there's no greater gift  
that we could ask for
