Six months of night  
said Bear Man  
then six months of daylight  
that way we sleep  
through the cold winters  
take advantage of the spring  
and summer months  
for fattening up  
begetting cubs  
giving their mothers time  
to teach their young

Oh no said Ant Woman  
there is no time to waste  
so much to do  
so very much  
we need the days  
to follow quickly on the nights  
twenty four hours  
surely enough for both  
darkness and daylight  
and so they argued  
until it was agreed  
the way to settle the affair  
was by a song contest

Bear Man thought "Good!  
I can outsing her easily"  
and sure enough  
in the first round  
he came on strong  
but with each succeeding round  
Ant Woman came on stronger  
sang higher as she pulled her waist in  
ever tighter while Bear Man  
begain to yawn  
and feel the pull of sleep  
and so the judges  
ruled for Ant Woman  
and we have night and day  
in swift succession  
but bears are still content to sleep  
away the winter  
while the ant people  
with their impossibly thin waists  
keep a busy household
