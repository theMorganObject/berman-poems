The evening wind is gusting  
through our garden  
shaking the maple leaves  
bending the boughs  
my wife is mixing soil  
with her bare hands  
adding nutrients  
transplanting flower starts  
my thoughts are elsewhere  
with our family scattered  
coast to coast  
and overseas  
siblings in Turkey  
Brazil Brooklyn California  
our children  
in West Virginia  
Portland Oregon  
and Humboldt County  
out on the Redwood Coast  
neices and nephews  
likewise spread afield  
their children  
some still infants  
others halfway to their teens  
and our grandchildren  
whom we've not seen  
in far too long  
thanks to the Covid  
the twins turned sixteen  
and their younger brother  
will be thirteen in a week  
we miss them all  
so much and now  
in three more days  
my wife and I  
are heading out  
to see our son  
daughter-in-law  
and grandchildren  
I listen to the wind  
tossing the leaves  
the sound an echo  
of my restless thoughts  
and my impatience  
to be on our way
