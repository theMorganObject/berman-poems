The radio relates the current violence  
in Jerusalem  
a city that through centuries has seen  
more than her share  
twenty-five years have passed  
since I was there  
and saw the sites  
of Palestinian homes  
destroyed back in the forties  
bombed to make them  
uninhabitable  
it seemed horrific then  
and now again  
we see the Jewish state  
evicting Arabs  
from their homes to make room  
for the so-called "settlers"  
it makes me sick at heart  
that fellow jews  
have turned to weapons  
of contemporary warfare  
killing even if inadvertently  
women and children  
I'm ready to renounce  
my membership  
but better to speak out  
to ask the question  
some are already asking  
will the price  
of a Jewish homeland  
be the loss  
of Jewish values  
of the Jewish soul?
