A quiet night  
the kitty rubbing up  
against my feet  
I sit in my bathrobe  
trying to write  
distracted by the ticking  
of the wind-up clock  
loud in the absence  
of all other sounds  
only the clock  
and the low humming  
in my ear  
my tinnitus  
I haven't known true silence  
since it started  
at first I fought it  
futile effort  
then I told myself  
it's one more way  
that God is trying  
to break through  
the walls I've built  
between us  
even so  
it's easy to ignore  
that silent voice  
but sometimes  
like tonight  
I choose to listen  
no words  
but infinite meaning  
now the clock  
strikes midnight  
time for sleep
