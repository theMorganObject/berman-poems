The ocean  
 how I've missed it  
 this past year

Remembering  
 our dogs  
 racing the length

Of a warm  
 sunny beach  
 barking at gulls

Today at last  
 we drove out  
 to the coast

Under blue skies  
 threading the soft  
 green hills

To Crescent City  
 where we hit  
 the shore

Cold overcast  
 a choppy sea  
 grey, uninviting

Hardly the welcome  
 we'd been  
 hoping for

But we'll come back  
 another day  
 perhaps in June

The dogs predict  
 a gentler wind  
 and warmer sand
