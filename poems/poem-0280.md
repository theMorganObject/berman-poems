Not long after  
 the family  
 had gone to bed

my son, his wife  
 my grandchildren  
 the dog

their cat came  
 out of hiding  
 and jumped up

onto the kitchen  
 table where  
 I sat

trying to write  
 he paid me  
 scant attention

save for a moment's stare  
 he sniffed  
 my shirt

checked out an  
 empty teacup  
 slowly walked

across the page  
 that I was  
 writing on

jumped down  
 and disappeared  
 into the room

leaving behind  
 a feeling  
 that he'd looked

me over and  
 and judged me  
 simply not worth

the time it might  
 take him to  
 know me better

though earlier  
 he'd let me  
 stroke his back

it seems that  
 counted little  
 in his book
