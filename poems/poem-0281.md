There's days the Redwood Coast  
feels like a drowned landscape  
an underwater world  
the air so thick and wet  
you'd think a person would  
need gills to breathe it in

Together with my wife  
my son and my grandson  
I walk along a path  
where willow and toyon  
crowd in on either side  
and sometimes overhead

We come out in the open  
just where the river turns  
northward toward Clam Beach  
the view is breathtaking  
a sea of yellow lupine  
bejeweling the dunes  
the flowers seem to glow  
with their own inner light

Clambering down the slope  
and out onto the shore  
our dogs, till now restrained  
come suddenly alive  
racing along the waves  
that creep up to our feet  
they chase after the gulls  
with evident delight

My grandson,scooping sand  
ununcovers a mole crab  
it wriggles in his palm  
a tiny tidal life  
sand dollars strewn about  
most broken but some whole  
a cockle shell completes  
our little treasure trove

And now it's time to say  
our goodbyes to the beach  
our spirits are refreshed  
our senses are enriched  
by all we've seen and heard  
the salt air we've been breathing  
the thunder of the surf  
follows even as we're leaving
