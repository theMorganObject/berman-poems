Running across John Woolley  
after all these years  
still possibly the sweetest man  
I've ever known  
and he remembered me  
while it took me  
a few moments to place him  
once I did  
I flood of memories  
came rushing in

He told me that his second grandchild  
had been born  
only eight days before  
he seemed elated  
and Carroll, my wife, reminded him  
that she'd once met his son  
the father of this newborn  
at a party  
hosted by a mutual friend  
a musical soiree though neither she  
nor he were among those of us  
who played

He mentioned just in passing  
his wife Ann Marie  
with whom I'd sung  
played music  
who had been  
a member of our little folk band  
Macchu Picchu  
and who had died of cancer  
now five years this June

John was so warm  
so gracious that I've felt  
my spirits lifted  
since that brief encounter  
yesterday  
as if it were his gift  
to heal the grief  
that others feel for him  
whose loss was and is real  
I'm glad for his new grandson
