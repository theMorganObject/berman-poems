is the title of the book  
that lay in my friend's lap  
the day they found him  
his customary smile  
so I was told  
still on his face  
this much-loved man  
who only recently  
had earned a captain's license  
found a ship  
to take around the Horn  
or at least skipper  
on the Columbia  
downstream from Portland  
I see him now on deck  
hand on the rigging  
a friend's macaw  
perched on his shoulder  
no simple sailor  
more likely a pirate  
the book  
one of O'Brian's tales  
of Captain Aubry  
the title seems auspicious  
for Jim's final voyage
