There's a photo I can picture  
if I close my eyes  
taken in August  
nineteen seventy  
black and white  
it's of my mother's father  
Ralphie to his wife  
my grandmother  
Dr. Harlow to some  
grandpa to me  
I thought that he was dying  
and I'd come  
from California  
to his summer home  
on Martha's Vineyard

I took the picture from behind  
while he sat silent  
as if in prayer or meditation  
in his wheelchair  
gazing out across the calm Lagoon  
toward Vineyard Haven harbor  
in the photo  
a blur of light  
reflecting from the water  
surrounds him like a halo  
it's as if  
he's staring off  
into eternity  
although from where I stood  
I couldn't tell  
whether his eyes  
were closed or open

I remember that I asked  
what he was thinking  
and he answered  
he was listening to hymns  
he'd known from childhood  
hymns we'd sung on Sunday evenings  
over many summers  
family and friends  
sitting on couches  
or folding chairs  
there in the livingroom  
while we children all sat  
on cushions on the floor  
my mother playing  
the old upright piano

I wonder  
was he hearing those same voices  
still reverberating  
in the livingroom  
just past the door  
where he was sitting  
in his wheelchair  
listening
