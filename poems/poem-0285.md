Today was Thursday - Thor's Day  
and sure enough it rained  
I guess the god was moved  
to wield his hammer  
one more time  
before the long dry  
summer was upon us

After a mild winter  
like this past one  
every drop is precious  
all the more so  
in these mountains  
prone to summer fires

So we bless  
the rain that falls  
as Mathew says  
both on the just  
and on the unjust  
and we only hope  
it will decide  
to fall on us
