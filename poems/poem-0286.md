Under the apple tree  
in your back yard  
that's where the treasure lies  
waiting for you  
to dream the journey  
that will take you  
far from home  
walking for many days  
to reach the city  
with its walls  
and guarded gates  
where you will meet the man  
who dreamt of you  
only the night before

He will recount the dream  
not knowing it was you  
he dreamed of  
and from him  
you'll learn the secret  
you've been seeking  
though you knew nothing  
of a secret  
only that your dream  
had sent you  
walking down the road

Now that you've learned  
where to dig  
you can begin the even longer  
journey home  
the way will seem  
endless at times  
but if you take  
a moment to reflect  
you'll realize the treasure  
is already yours
