If bees were bears  
 and bears were bees  
 they'd build their homes  
 at the bottoms of trees  
 Winnie the Pooh

Honey-eater, shaggy coat  
bruin - the brown one  
Sanskrit rksha  
the destroyer  
(of huts, of hives?)  
myedvyed in Russian  
"honey-seeker" and in Greek arktos  
meaning perhaps "the hugger"  
his true name unknown  
not to be spoken  
aloud for fear he'd hear  
and come for you

Big and Little Bears so Father Zeus  
set them circling the pole  
and placed the bear star  
Arcturus close by  
thus from arktos the arctic  
the bear land  
watched over by star forms  
that prowl the northern sky

I watched a family of bears  
rubbing their backs  
against a tree  
like playful adolescents  
and like us they're omnivores  
but with more insects  
than we prefer and nothing cooked  
still of the animals they seem  
most like us in their ways

Given my family name it's little wonder  
I'm drawn to these wild cousins  
thinking of those times not so far distant  
when we shared living quarters  
and though they're known  
for being clumsy  
I suspect the one who's clumsy  
is more the Berman  
than the bear
