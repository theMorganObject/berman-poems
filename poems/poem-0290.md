It was all so clear  
the air  
the beach  
with sunlight and blue water stretching on  
to the horizon  
nothing seemed strange  
nothing extraordinary  
not even the mane  
that swept down behind his head  
a lion's head but smaller  
a good match  
for his slender human body  
just the two of us  
he motioned with his hand  
and walked deliberately  
into the sea  
I followed and discovered  
I could breathe  
easily under water

At first I kept up  
with his steady pace  
feet planted on the ocean floor  
but at a certain depth  
I was too buoyant  
too light  
to follow in his footsteps  
so I turned  
back toward the shore

Yet even there  
I heard him singing joyfully  
a song of victory  
resounding through the depths  
of time and space  
through all the countless galaxies  
of this unfathomable  
universe and then I woke  
with that great hymn still sounding  
deep and clear  
a distant temple bell  
and though with age it's faded  
there are times I wake  
to hear it still
