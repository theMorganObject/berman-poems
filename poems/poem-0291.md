Ten years since my mom died  
and I've not dreamed of her  
not once that I remember  
and I like to think  
it means that she's moved on  
and I as well  
but in another way  
since she is with me  
always now that I see the world  
she loved so dearly  
the birds and flowers  
the garden  
trees and clouds  
with a new clarity and tenderness  
it's as if she'd bequeathed me  
her vision

She was a spunky one  
she had to be  
to hold her own  
with her belovedhusband  
best friend and adversary  
Oh Ruth he would say  
how could you speak  
such nonsense!  
and she right back Oh Harold  
whatever makes you think  
you're in the right?

Sixty-six years of marriage only made them  
more themselves  
in memory I see them  
walking side by side  
my father half a step  
ahead they're coming back  
from watching the sun set  
over the water  
ready to settle down  
for another evening  
in their Vineyard home
