A song that caught the moment  
and the mood  
a country welcoming its soldiers home  
at the war's end  
in nineteen forty-five  
and Doris Day  
had just the voice  
sweetly nostalgic  
for an innocence  
that she and we perhaps  
had scarcely known  
I say we though I was only  
two that year  
ten years later  
after I turned twelve  
my cousin Linda  
taught me how to dance  
a foxtrot was it?  
to a recording of that tune  
I hadn't thought of it  
in over sixty years  
but today it's playing  
like a stuck record  
in the jukebox of my mind  
is there a message  
something that I'm missing?  
or is it simply  
a reflection of my mood  
after some fifteen months  
of huddling at home  
playing it safe  
waiting out the virus  
the travel bug is buzzing  
in my ear  
I'm ready for a sentimental  
journey of my own
