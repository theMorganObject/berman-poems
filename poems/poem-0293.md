Dear Mr Putin  
I hope you will forgive my naiveté  
asking such an obvious and silly question  
but do you care how you will be remembered  
in times to come?  
and if so will your fostering of Lukashenko  
and his brutal regime  
a remnant of the bad old days  
more reminiscent of say a Mussolini  
or the Albanian dictator Enver Hoxha  
hardly someone to hold up  
to history's clearsighted scrutiny  
will this add luster to your own  
historic reputation or will it be  
merely an ugly blot upon your name?
