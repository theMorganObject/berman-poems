Will you be our granddaughter  
or grandson?  
big question though it matters  
not at all  
as far as the unbridled love  
you can expect from us  
and from your parents  
in fact from all the family  
now eagerly  
awaiting your arrival

Your parents choose to  
keep the question open  
although if there's another ultra-sound  
it might give you away  
it's so amazing  
to have already met you  
at three months  
still in our daughter's womb  
not yet quite human  
in appearance  
but clearly not a fish or salamander  
though you may someday  
merit such a moniker  
as monkey  
dove, or lizard  
hey little lizard  
someone who loves you  
may shout out  
where are you rushing off to now?
