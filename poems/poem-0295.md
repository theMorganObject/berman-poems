Did she come back for it  
the doe  
who left her newborn fawn  
beside our shed ?  
was she a first-time mother  
and bewildered ?  
our neighbor pointed out the tiny creature  
curled up in the grass  
so still and so well hidden  
just a patch of brown  
sprinkled with spots  
of white  
hard to resist  
the urge to interfere  
to try and bottle feed it  
but what then?  
probably best  
let nature take its course  
at least that's the folk wisdom  
now it's been  
a whole day and I've not gone back  
to check  
tomorrow morning  
will be soon enough  
it's no great matter in the  
larger scheme  
and yet the thought  
of this small life  
left there to die  
so close to our front door  
is troubling
