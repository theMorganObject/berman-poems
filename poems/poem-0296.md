No one has done it better than Villon  
whose fame is justly recognized  
but does this mean  
you have to be a criminal  
imprisoned  
pardoned and later  
sentenced to be hanged  
then disappear  
with no one knowing where  
or how you met your end?

Poetry and crime  
it's worth considering  
if what you're after is a name  
to last the centuries  
like Villon or his contemporary  
Thomas Malory  
whose tales of Lancelot and Guinevere  
the knights of the Round Table  
and the quest  
for that most precious relic  
the Holy Grail  
inspire us still  
Malory whose prose is poetry  
also commited crimes  
and wrote his work  
Le Morte d'Arthur  
while under lock and key  
but as for me  
even had I such powers  
of creation  
I'd choose this bland  
and largely innocent  
domestic life  
and settle for obscurity  
rather than risk  
the wrath of kings and constables  
and I would leave as my  
some lines that witness only  
to my love of flowers  
of birds and critters  
children's faces  
family scenes  
less thrilling  
but a celebration nonetheless  
of what I like to think  
we all hold dear  
and even more so when  
the end is near
