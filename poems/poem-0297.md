or at the least  
a full-on smile  
from someone  
serious as me  
known to be  
a bit slow on the uptake  
often caught  
thinking dark thoughts  
of global warming  
or violence in Somalia  
closer to home  
it's those unanswered emails  
tasks set aside and promises  
long overdue  
my wife cuts through it all  
she wants a smile  
both for herself  
and for the photo  
I've requested  
without a moment's thought  
she deftly pulls  
her shirt over her head  
and stands there posing  
like a naughty schoolgirl  
naked from the waist up  
so many years  
we've slept together  
and still that's all it takes  
to shake me loose  
of any thoughts  
and leave me  
as if spellbound  
laughing helplessly  
for just a moment  
and then smiling  
with delight  
and gratitude for the wisdom  
and the whimsy  
that she brings  
to this alchemy  
this work of making magic  
from the stuff  
of daily life  
my unmatched companion  
teacher lover friend  
beloved wife
