I expect it was  
the Chinese miners  
come for gold  
a hundred fifty years ago  
who named it Shan  
meaning mountain in Chinese  
our friend whose house  
lies here under the trees  
tells us of hearing tales  
of mining camps  
along the creek  
she mentions this  
as we pass through a gate  
and down to where  
the water flows beneath  
the forest canopy  
dark in the twilight  
running over rocks  
the little riffles making  
water songs  
we're told the creek  
once hosted salmon  
and though now  
only a few yards wide  
with winter rains  
she says with pride  
it really roars  
in her voice I feel how much  
she loves this stream  
this place she knew  
when she was young  
and left  
and then returned again  
to make her home
