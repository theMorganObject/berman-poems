The sound of my old dog  
snoring quietly beside me  
is such a comfort  
though I'm at a loss  
as to the reason why  
perhaps it's simply hearing him  
breathe peacefully and knowing  
that asleep he's free  
to be the puppy  
he once was

If there's something more  
something I haven't  
put my finger on  
then that's all right  
no need to think it further  
just another hour  
and I'll be in my bed asleep  
and likely snoring too

And if she's still awake  
my wife may feel  
the same deep sense  
of peace hearing me snore  
and knowing that my heart  
as faithful as our kitchen clock  
is beating close to hers
