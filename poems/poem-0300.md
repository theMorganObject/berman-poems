The bard of Stratford  
gave the line to Dogberry  
master of malaprops  
whose very name  
gives him away  
comparisons  
he says  
are odorous  
thus stumbling on the proverb  
yet the saying stands  
even as he spoke it  
and any odors  
thus invoked  
most likely smell  
unpleasant at the least  
but who of us  
refrains from that too human vice  
comparing mine  
with yours  
hoping that yours  
will suffer in the process  
while what's mine  
will come out smelling  
like a rose  
so now we're back  
to odors once again  
it seems there's no escape  
and so the bard wrote true  
though like these lines  
it comes to nothing more  
than much ado
