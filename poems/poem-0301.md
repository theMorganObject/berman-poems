Driving through the Applegate  
a mile or two  
before the bridge  
I looked out  
to my left and there  
beside the road  
a farmyard pond  
banked with green rushes  
and a clump of tall cattails  
on one a redwinged blackbird stood  
I see it still  
in my mind's eye  
a male in mating plumage  
his epaulet a brilliant  
red and yellow  
against the sheen of glossy black  
as I drove on  
I thought that's why we're here  
not for dominion  
but to be shaken by the beauty  
that shows up unannounced  
and often when  
we're only passing by
