My first time  
I was with some younger friends  
up on the mountain  
it was spring but there was still  
a bit of snow left  
so we made a snowball  
and threw it back and forth  
around the circle  
laughing as it shrank  
became no bigger  
than a marble  
melting away like time  
between our fingers

And then there was no time  
only the pines  
vibrating with a current  
so intense  
it seemed the trees were rooted  
in some boundless energy  
that flowing up their trunks  
shot out the needles  
causing the air to glow  
as if the needle tips  
were on the verge  
of bursting into flame

A young fir tree drew me  
into her arms  
her bending branches  
she had such a fragrance  
pungent and sweet  
I couldn't help but let her  
hold me in her soft embrace  
I've never looked at conifers  
the same way since

Years later in a novel by Asturias  
I came across a phrase that  
brought this day to mind  
like a man - he wrote -  
who's eaten mushrooms  
and sees the world as if  
for the first time
