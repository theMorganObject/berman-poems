To paint so clear a scene  
with so few words  
just twenty syllables  
that is a skill  
I envy and have  
yet to learn  
twelve centuries  
have passed and still the little maid  
stands deftly poling  
her light craft  
across the page  
her stash  
of stolen lily blossoms  
at her feet  
she's headed homeward  
through the thick duckweed  
that parts to let the boat  
pass through but leaves  
a wake that gives  
the heedless girl away
