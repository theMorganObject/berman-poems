Still vivid  
still a visceral memory  
the day I climbed the bluff  
below our summer home  
and my leg brushed  
against an insulated wire  
that I thought safe  
but was still live with current  
two hundred twenty volts that fed  
the pumphouse just below  
I lay there helpless  
flopping on the wire  
a fish caught on a hook  
and thrown down  
on the deck  
after awhile my body  
chose to flop off  
and like someone who's been  
struck by lightning  
and survived  
I felt as if I'd died  
and by some fluke  
come back among the living  
I suspect that's why  
though I was just a boy  
of ten or twelve  
I never told a soul
