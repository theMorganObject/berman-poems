Her face  
her slender torso  
on the laptop screen  
no longer young  
but now she seemed  
a child again  
smiling and somewhat frail  
after her surgery  
she'd come down  
below a hundred pounds  
she said  
was staying on in Taiwan  
with her family while she  
regained her strength  
her older brother  
cooking meals  
is he an ok cook  
I asked  
she laughed and said no  
not at all  
I felt a surge of love  
I hadn't felt for her  
in years  
not since our falling out  
over some silly business deal  
now with her illness  
both of us seemed ready  
to move on or rather  
to go back  
before our friendship went awry  
nothing like brushing up against  
life's transience to melt  
the frozen waters of our hearts

in the past we'd had a falling out  
but now I sensed we both  
were feeling something good  
and true about our friendship
