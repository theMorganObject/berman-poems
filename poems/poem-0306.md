The trick  
if for some reason  
you should wish  
to walk on water  
like Lord Jesus  
or the Russian holy man  
of the folk tale  
who shared that gift  
let's not forget  
with water striders  
and green basilisks  
is not to think of it  
as anything  
unusual or special  
in fact best  
never to think of it at all  
but to keep moving  
with unhurried diligence  
on God's behalf  
that is to say  
not for one's own  
but for the sake  
of strangers  
those in need  
and with the lightness  
both of foot and heart  
that comes unheralded  
with love's upwelling
