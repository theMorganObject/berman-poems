Not pipes for smoking  
these musical contrivances  
require special skill merely  
to say their names  
Galician gaita French musette  
chevrette and boha  
smallpipes Northumbrian and Scottish  
Swedish sackpipa  
uilleann pipes from Ireland  
from Bulgaria  
the deep voiced kaba gaida  
while the south  
of Italy boasts the zampogna  
bag an entire goat  
almost an orchestra  
with its double chanters  
its three drones  
then there's the warpipes  
highland clans would play  
to terrify their foes  
it seems that shepherds everywhere  
have found a use for goatskins  
pipes for dancing  
merrymaking  
Kevin knows their tricks  
he plays them all  
his charming modesty  
belies his gift  
this multiversatile ambassador  
of the reed and goatskin universe
