Other than dreams  
the ones that come once  
in a decade  
or two and upon waking  
you're a different person  
and the world  
a different place  
than you had known  
before you slept  
other than that  
there's only a small handful  
of moments in a lifetime  
when the waking world  
decides to shift  
before your eyes  
the landscape suddenly  
revealed as in a lightning flash  
the trees  
the distant hills  
hitherto hidden by the dark  
now coming clear

such as these  
appear alike to scientists  
and mystics  
and to each of us  
although we set aside  
these moments  
choose to live  
within the world that  
we're accustomed to  
only from time to time  
stopping to wonder  
why this sense  
of something missing  
something left behind  
while hurrying  
on our way
