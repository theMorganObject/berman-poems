Under the white quilt  
of its steep roof  
that slants down  
nearly to the ground  
the barn seems neither more  
nor less alive  
in its dark timbers  
the the oaks that flank  
it's sides  
as if to shield it  
with their overarching tracery  
of winter black  
the field in front  
is pocked with darker spots  
where weeds and blackberries  
poke through the snow  
the whole gives an impression  
of a world asleep  
deep in its memories  
of distant summer days
