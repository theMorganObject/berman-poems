It's a different world  
since babbo's gone  
that dear Geppetto  
who would rub my joints  
with linseed oil  
now that I have no one  
to run away from  
I spend too much time  
here on the bench  
my legs grown stiff  
as boards  
perhaps I'd have done better  
had I been a real puppet  
with strings  
and someone wiser than myself  
to work them  
of course I'd have missed out  
on all the great  
adventures that I'm famous for  
not to complain  
but if the stiffness in my limbs  
weren't bad enough  
my nose has grown  
longer of late  
no doubt it has to do  
with writing poems  
but tell me  
how else is an old blockhead  
like me to pass the time?
