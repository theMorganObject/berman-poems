This young fig  
with its five-fingered leaves  
leaning back against the south side  
of our house  
drinks in the June sunshine  
and all the water  
I can bring  
rewards us with  
its innocent display  
of small green fruit  
hanging like testicles  
but whose insides  
when ripe  
promise to be pink  
and sweet and soft  
like my love's secret rose
