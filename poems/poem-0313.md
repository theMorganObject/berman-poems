Leaving Jao Village the wind picked up  
 and by nightfall we reached Poplar Woods  
 having sailed 200 li in a single day

Earthshaking wind  
 the land streams past  
 as if in flood

Waves soaring skyward  
 carry the whole  
 the world aloft

Riverbank willows  
 twist and twirl  
 in their mad dance

Reeds bend and sway  
 in crazy  
 wild confusion

On either side  
 a thousand hills  
 stampeding horses

A single sail  
 sweeps us downstream  
 a hundred leagues

This old bird  
 blown and buffeted  
 is heading home

With heavy thoughts  
 his gilded cage  
 left far behind

    Yang Wanli  1127-1206
