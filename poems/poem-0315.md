Before my eyes a tiger swallowtail  
settles on a white carnation  
flutters off  
then circles back again  
to feed  
for that brief moment  
not a thought intrudes  
later I think  
what is it that I need  
by way of miracles  
surely this is enough  
had I landed  
on a distant planet  
and witnessed this  
a butterfly a flower  
would the wonder of it  
not suffice to scatter  
a lifetime's cares  
and doubts?
