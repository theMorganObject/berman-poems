Spirits of the forest pools  
water nymphs  
maidens who teach  
the joy of drifting  
with the flow  
at ease within life's  
rushing stream  
to you we sing  
play our mbiras  
dance to the beat  
of hosho rattles  
you whose finny avatars  
the playful bream fish  
frisk and frolic  
in the deep pools  
njuzu spirits  
gracious mothers  
look kindly on us  
grateful children  
bless us  
with life-giving rain
