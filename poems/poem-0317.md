Here in the West  
the summer heat  
has come on strong  
already turned the hills  
to tinder  
lightning fires  
have taken off  
not far from here  
how will we fare  
through coming months  
July and August  
and on till November  
when the autumn rains  
should bring relief  
I sigh remembering  
the year just past  
when smoke from wildfires  
filled our valley  
and our friends  
in nearby towns  
lost homes to fire  
though we've been spared  
I can't but feel  
a sense of loss  
thinking of when  
I was a boy  
on the East Coast  
and June meant  
getting out of school  
and the bright prospect  
of a summer in the sun  
at our vacation home  
out off the Cape  
an island's gift  
fresh ocean air  
a world away  
from these dry hills  
that threaten  
to go up in flames  
on any day  
that summer lightning  
sparks a fire  
and the wind rises
