Hey Hank  
what were you thinking?  
eighty years old  
and taking off  
by yourself  
in that rattletrap  
of a plane  
nearly as rickety as you  
you alte kaker  
with your  
heart problems  
your insomnia  
your feet so swollen  
you could barely walk  
I know you didn't plan it  
but I like to think  
you saw an exit sign  
an off ramp in the sky  
and chose to take it  
at least the end was quick  
but don't imagine  
that you and I are done  
there's still a lot  
of ground to cover  
stories to share  
and Yiddish songs  
we've yet to sing  
you go first  
I'll be listening  
waiting to join in
