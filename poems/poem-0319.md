We were sitting out  
on the back porch  
I'd noticed  
that a sort of philosophic  
banter seemed to help my aging friend  
with his anxieties  
his OCD  
I asked him what he thought  
mattered the most  
in life

before dementia took hold  
he'd been a teacher  
high school principal  
an avid bird watcher  
now he needed  
every ten or fifteen minutes  
to check the front door knob  
he was about to say  
something in answer  
to my question  
when a flock of starlings  
flew into a tree  
some twenty feet away  
he pointed to the tree  
its branches quivering  
with birds  
and with deep feeling  
even sorrow  
in his voice  
he said it's hard  
to know what matters most  
when they keep moving  
moving around like that
