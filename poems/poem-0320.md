Dear Hank,  
I'm writing to tell you  
about your funeral  
in case you decided  
to skip it

Your son Rob  
broke down  
even while telling us  
stories of how over-  
bearing you could be  
as a father  
and also shared  
his deep gratitude for your  
constant love and support

Your brother Phil  
having just recently  
found in Hasidism  
something he could lean upon  
had arranged for Rabbi Avi  
to perform a service  
at odds with everything  
we know about you  
though had you been there  
I doubt you would have found it  
overly distasteful

Reb Avi  
who told us how he once  
had brought matzah ball soup  
up to your door expressed regret  
that you and he  
would have no chance to take up  
where you left off  
speaking with his usual warmth  
and his good spirits  
he informed us  
with the assurance  
of a man of faith  
how your soul's journey  
in these days following  
your death  
was to unfold

Your sweet wife Norma  
kept a low profile  
while reaching out to all of us  
and was I thought  
exemplary in every way  
her sister Linda  
told the story of how  
you and Norma had met  
Norma the bellydancer  
you the dashing young musician  
in Linda's telling  
sparks were flying  
from the start

Your Latino friend  
and fellow pilot  
who shared the hanger where  
you kept your plane  
spoke movingly of how  
when he was thirsty  
you'd found water for him  
and how he'd driven out  
to pick you up  
the morning  
of your final flight  
seen you fly over  
moments later  
heard the crash  
there was a photo  
of you two smiling  
sitting in your plane  
taken the day before  
it's an image  
that I think touched us all

And your friend Milton  
told of how you'd flown together  
in his plane  
north up the road to Seven Feathers  
a quick jaunt  
for lunch at the casino  
and on the way back  
run into bad weather  
the local airfields all socked in  
the plane itself he said  
appeared to turn itself around  
not one for putting stock  
in miracles Milton confessed he'd found  
it all a bit uncanny  
in any case you'd managed  
to land up in Roseburg  
slept in a motel  
and flown home safely  
the next day

After the psalms  
and Hebrew prayers  
we lowered you  
in your pine box  
you were a heavy load  
then we took turns  
with shovels laying dirt  
into the grave  
the spot was just above  
the little Ashland airfield  
so that even now  
you get to hear the planes  
take off and land  
as they fly over  
I can imagine you  
lying there  
in your casket  
smiling to yourself
