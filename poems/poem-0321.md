In the end  
will that be all of us?  
will there be another planet  
we can run to?  
maybe we can build underwater cities  
or learn to live  
oh well it's not the first extinction  
it's the 6th  
and life has always bounced back  
with exhuberance  
after only a few million years

I have friends  
who've had enough of summer smoke  
and the need to have  
evacuation plans  
and like some other species  
that I've heard about  
are moving further north  
it's not like islands  
lost to rising oceans  
but even here in Oregon  
there's a new restlessness  
I know folks  
who lost their homes  
in last fall's fires  
others who fear the ones  
that may be coming  
and who are looking  
for a place where it's less dry  
less vulnerable  
as for me although I've heard myself  
swear that this last move  
would be in fact  
the last and though I'm feeling  
settled here in town  
I can imagine if the summers  
keep us shut indoors  
thanks to the heat  
or to the smoke from nearby fires  
we might consider one last move  
I hear the coast  
is green as ever and the ocean  
is where it's always been  
at least in my lifetime
