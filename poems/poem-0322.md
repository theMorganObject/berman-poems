for Carroll

How well it suits you  
and how wonderfully you fill it  
the dress our friend Laurel  
persuaded you to buy  
that time we visited  
in Honolulu

The vibrant blues  
a brilliant contrast  
to the dullness  
of our local palette  
zipping it up the back  
I watch you step away  
and am transported  
to another place  
more colorful  
more sensuous  
like breathing in  
Oahu's ocean air  
or the perfume  
of a passion flower

You say you think  
it's time to let it go  
because you've filled out some  
and it's a little tight  
but we who love you  
say oh please  
that dress is perfect for you  
it's as if it summons  
something of your spirit  
to the surface  
a graciousness  
and grace  
that's beyond gender  
yet deeply feminine  
filling the room  
with laughter  
light and love
