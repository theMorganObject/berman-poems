for Elizabeth Kolbert

Living through so many decades lost  
to indecision in high places  
years of denial  
displacement of the  
so-called climate refugees  
and the suffering  
the chaos that ensued  
it's been my fate  
to be one of the few  
who still remember  
the sky when it was blue  
and not this pale  
white overcast that we've created  
with our efforts to push back  
the overheating of the planet  
which with all its consequences  
has brought the nations  
to their everloving knees  
I miss the sky  
I knew when I was young  
it's blueness was a gift  
that soothed the eyes  
now that it's gone  
most folks I know deny  
that such a thing existed  
but I know it will come back  
though only after  
we've run our course  
have left the court to others  
I wish them well  
who or whatever they may be
