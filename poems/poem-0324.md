Heidegger asked the question  
for which I've yet  
to find an answer  
although it concerns me  
and maybe you - reader - as well  
what use are poets  
and their works  
in catastrophic times  
which even if we set aside  
wars and pandemics  
is still an apt description  
of our age  
true this is not  
our plante's first extinction  
only the first  
we've brought about ourselves  
and are now privileged  
to witness close at hand  
perhaps that witnessing  
is some part of the answer  
to the question about poets  
and their work  
though for my part  
I prefer to think of poetry  
less as witnessing than exploration  
and as another poet put it  
old men should be explorers  
with any luck I'll be one  
to the end
