For all that might be said  
against a lawn  
a patch of grass beside a house  
or out in front  
serving a purely esthetic purpose  
and requiring use  
of resources like water  
and the need to own  
a lawnmower  
and taking up  
the soil where fruit and vegetables  
could just as easily be grown  
this artifact  
for which we thank the British aristocracy  
who needed it for garden parties  
and croquet  
and to impress and entertain  
their peers  
has so become the norm  
it's hard to think  
of how things could be different  
but for all that might  
be said against it  
in a time of drought  
like now  
I must admit it makes a lovely setting  
for the robin who has  
landed just a dozen  
feet away and cocked his head  
keeping his eye on me  
while listening for worms
