Should be able to relax a bit  
take these last miles  
at a more meditative pace  
but something in me  
feels if anything an urge  
to push on just a little harder  
as if the finish line  
still out of sight  
beyond those trees  
were beckoning  
saying come on  
this is your final chance  
to show the world  
what stuff you're made of
