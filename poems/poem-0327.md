After months of letting it  
lie idleÂ in its case  
and because my heart  
was breaking for our daughter  
and for her unborn  
daughter whose own heart  
the doctors say  
will require surgery at birth  
and more surgeries to follow  
assuming she survives the first  
last night I took out the old flamenco  
guitar made for me  
by my friend Les Stansell  
using native sitka spruce  
that he himself had milled  
and played that saddest and most  
soulful of the toques  
a cry from the parched soil  
of Andaluz  
the toque Lorca must  
have had in mind  
when he invoked the guitar  
as a heart  
wounded by five swords
