In my dream I joined the band  
of lay disciples  
tugging like mules  
harnessed to turn a water wheel  
everyone so earnest  
pulling hard  
making our way around the circle  
with our load  
when suddenly it seemed so comical  
I burst out laughing  
and could barely stop  
even while straining  
to pull the wheel around  
beside my friend  
the young man who had brought me  
to this dharma hall  
which clearly lacked a teacher  
and I thought  
to introduce him to the WayPlace  
in Ukiah  
where Dharma Master Hua  
once turned the wheel  
so effortlessly with his  
playful levity  
and humor though there was no question  
of his serious intent  
but then I thought  
of how since his Nirvana  
the place had changed  
and I awoke  
knowing it's been years  
since I last laughed like that
