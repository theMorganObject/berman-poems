So tenderly my wife  
held out to me  
this small brown frog  
that she'd found swimming  
in our hot tub  
left unheated for the summer  
placed the creature gingerly  
in my cupped hands  
I felt it squirm  
and then transferred it  
to an empty coffee mug  
from which it managed  
to escape by squeezing through  
the drinking hole in the mug's lid

After retrieving it a second time  
I brought it  
to our tiny backyard pond  
where he or maybe she  
without a moment's hesitation  
made the move  
described so beautifully  
by Basho  
a quick leap and the ensuing  
sound that water makes  
a quiet plunk which  
told me that the frog  
was safely home  
but what still lingered  
was the sound  
the single note of music  
that the water made  
on taking in this leaping life  
a sound I'm hearing  
if just faintly  
even now
