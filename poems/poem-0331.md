There's news of fires  
burning to the south  
and to the east  
while further afield news  
of extreme weather  
famine and disease  
and all the many woes  
that we inflict  
on one another  
through our ignorance  
and greed  
and our too human fears  
then is it wrong  
to cling as I do  
to the peace  
that fills this room  
the old dog sleeping  
stretched out on the rug  
the cat curled napping  
in his favorite chair  
while I sit drousing  
even as I write  
feeling the quiet  
enter with each breath  
savoring the gift  
of peace and rest
