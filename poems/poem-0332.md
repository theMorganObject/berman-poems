The little ferry brought us  
from Sirmione  
and the medieval castle  
past the ruins of the Roman villa  
where they say Catullus  
once held court  
poet of adolescent loves and hates  
and of debaucheries that he was privy to  
the poems he called songs  
all very personal  
contemporary in their candor  
yet one wonders  
why there's nothing in them  
of the beauty  
that surrounds us here  
this lake set like  
a sapphire with its border  
of gemstone towns  
backed up against the hills  
that rise sharply behind them  
hills that to the north  
become the towering Dolomites  
Limone named  
for the famed lemon trees  
that the Venetians  
planted long ago  
and are no longer  
grown for export  
though the town  
is still well stocked  
with the namesake liqueur  
the limoncello  
which we three  
once we'd moved  
into our rooms  
and settled ourselves  
out on the balcony  
watching the lake turn  
from bright to dim  
to dark  
were more than happy to imbibe
