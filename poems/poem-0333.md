A quiet night  
here on the edge of town  
no breath of air  
no cars along our road  
the stillness seems uncanny  
and I half expect  
to hear coyotes  
such as used to sing  
on nights like this  
outside our country home  
filling the silence  
with their banshee wail  
I'd lie in bed and listen  
and be glad  
that something of the wild  
had come so close  
here in town we have  
the neighbor's children  
splashing eachother  
in their backyard pool  
their laughter spilling over  
through the fence  
delighting us old timers  
but on summer nights  
like this I miss the chorus  
of the frogs and crickets  
so loud sometimes we'd close  
the bedroom window  
and the coyotes  
whose night wailing  
was a message  
from another world  
a message that  
gave meaning to our own
