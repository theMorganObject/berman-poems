The young knight  
had surprised her  
as she went  
for water at the well  
and being naked  
beneath her smock  
she had to think  
of something quickly  
for he'd been quick  
to ask her  
for her hand

Roses she told him  
bring three roses  
freshly blooming  
on this year's stems  
just that  
and I'll consent  
to marry you

The youth rode off  
it was the dead of winter  
not a rose in bloom  
but he soon found  
an artist who agreed  
to paint three roses  
in full blooming  
on fresh green stems  
he paid the artist  
took the roses back

Oh no she said  
I wasn't serious  
oh but I was  
the youth replied  
and took you at your word  
so now you must  
do as you promised  
and you alone will have  
my heart forever

And here the ballad ends  
one likes to think  
the girl came round  
charmed by his cleverness  
and promise of lifelong devotion  
but all that  
is left to our imaginings
