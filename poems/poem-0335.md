There was Newton  
and the story of the apple  
scarcely more credible  
than the other older story  
and there was Einstein  
thinking his way more deeply  
into time and space  
than anyone before him  
and now some hold to string theory  
which postulates a particle  
unimaginably small  
but I imagine gravity an angel  
God's chief architect  
whose handiwork  
is manifest  
in individual atoms and in stars  
whole galaxies still coalescing  
out of dust  
let's call it love  
this force that holds us  
to our planet  
keeps this earth  
tethered close  
but not too closely  
to its star  
which likewise spins  
through space on its long journey  
circling the center  
of the Milky Way  
held on its course  
by this angelic power

poem 337 - Gardening in the Dark

My wife is out there  
gardening in the dark  
at any cost determined  
to bring order  
to our backyard jungle  
plants that she  
has nurtured with such care  
that they have grown  
out of proportion  
and transformed our little yard  
into a jungle  
now she's Jane to my  
unprepossessing Tarzan  
and I half expect  
to see her swinging from  
the grapevines  
that have overrun  
the holly trees  
and dangle like lianas  
I can only hope  
that she comes in  
before the leopards get her

I sing the angel of gravity  
creation's right hand man  
who from the first  
has been working  
on behalf of the cosmic plan  
a matchmaker of sorts  
his task has been bringing together  
the particles that make atoms  
the clouds of gases  
that make the stars  
and the planets the stars  
keep on tether  
both architect and artist  
the galaxies in their glory  
pay homage to his powers
