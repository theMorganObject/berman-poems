There was Newton  
and the story of the apple  
scarcely more credible  
than the other older story  
and there was Einstein  
thinking his way more deeply  
into time and space  
than anyone before him  
and now some hold to string theory  
which postulates a particle  
unimaginably small  
but I imagine gravity an angel  
God's chief architect  
whose handiwork  
is manifest  
in individual atoms and in stars  
whole galaxies still coalescing  
out of dust  
let's call it love  
this force that holds us  
to our planet  
keeps this earth  
tethered close  
but not too closely  
to its star  
which likewise spins  
through space on its long journey  
circling the center  
of the Milky Way  
held on its course  
by this angelic power
