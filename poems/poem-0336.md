At least the virus waited  
till you turned eighty-one  
still too soon, too early  
in your full-bodied life  
husband and lover  
father and grandfather  
passionate dancer  
though only with your wife  
skilled potter  
motorcycle fiend  
today we celebrated  
and mourned  
heard you son choke up  
remembering  
your daughter speak  
her gratitude and praise  
your humor  
wisdom as a father  
your wife tell of your friendships  
not so many but lifelong  
and deep  
and now you sleep  
a man well loved  
who lived life to the full  
Jerry Hult sleep well
