My wife is out there  
at any cost determined  
to bring order  
to our backyard  
the plants that she  
has nurtured with such care  
have grown all out of proportion  
and transformed our little yard  
into a jungle  
now she's Jane to my  
unprepossessing Tarzan  
and I half expect  
to see her swinging from  
the grapevines  
that have overrun  
the holly trees  
and dangle like lianas  
I can only hope  
that she comes in  
before the leopards get her
