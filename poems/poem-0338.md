You're not gone  
not gone not gone  
you live on  
live on live on  
your genes are present  
in our genes  
your minds a riddle  
for our minds  
you had by far  
the longer run  
so don't be sad  
your day is done  
you would find  
this world we've made  
no place for  
a well knapped blade  
such as you worked  
with art and skill  
no mastodons are left to fill  
the belly of a hungry child  
the great beasts long since  
quit the wild  
the wild itself barely survives  
be glad you knew it  
when your lives  
were intimately intertwined  
with all the life  
your world contained  
rest easy knowing even if  
we have embraced you  
and your gift  
acknowledged you  
as next of kin  
an ancestor beneath the skin  
the world you knew  
will always be  
safely veiled  
in mystery
