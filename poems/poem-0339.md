Like Pooh I'm up  
a honey tree  
hoping the bees  
will hear my hum  
and think that I  
am one of them  
not noticing  
my blue balloon  
and heffalumps  
whose tracks I see  
circling around  
the honey tree  
will hear the rumble  
in my throat  
and thoughtfully  
leave me alone  
but even if  
my nose is stung  
the taste of honey's  
worth the pain  
and I'll be up  
the tree again  
as long as bees  
keep making honey  
what else is a  
Pooh bear to do  
it's in my bones  
and not for you  
to tell me I'm  
a silly bear  
though if you should  
don't think I'd care!
