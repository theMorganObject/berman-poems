This spring the black bamboo  
I planted just last fall  
launched six new shoots  
like baby rockets  
heading skyward  
now in mid-July  
they tower above me  
swaying in the breeze  
the slender side branches  
leafed out as in  
a Chinese brush painting  
if as I think  
it was the Greeks  
taught us to see  
the human form  
the muscles rippling  
beneath the skin  
the sensuous breasts  
and graceful limbs  
of Aphrodite  
then it's the Chinese love  
of the bamboo  
its stalks  
a paradigm of strenth  
in flexibility  
of growing like the seasons  
node to node  
the hollow core  
embodying the wisdom  
of Buddihst saints  
and Daoist sages  
love that informs  
the Chinese painter's art  
from which I too  
have learned to find a sort  
of sensuous pleasure  
in the dark  
and swaying branches  
rustling leaves
