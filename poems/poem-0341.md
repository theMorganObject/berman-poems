    			for Daniel

Even with my eyes half open  
I can see it  
as I saw it then  
though it's been forty years  
and more  
it was just down the road  
from where we moved  
the year my son  
turned two  
who now has twins  
starting to think of college

Looking across the broad  
outcrop of rock  
musseled and barnacled  
grey cliffs skirting the headland  
with the ocean pushing hard  
on all three sides  
swells sweeping in  
spray whooshing  
through the blowhole  
with the sound  
of rushing wind  
and white mist rising  
dragons swirling in the air  
then falling back  
dispersing till the rush  
of the next wave

This was the place  
my son brought me  
when he was three and four  
and five holding my hand  
as we climbed down  
as close as it felt safe  
watching as dragons  
rose up in the air  
only to vanish  
making space for the next wave's  
wondrous creation
