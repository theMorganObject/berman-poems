The damselfly  
that just flew in and perched  
atop the stake  
I paced to lend support  
to a tomato plant  
is of the family  
libellulidae with accent  
I imagine on the u  
its members known  
simply as common skimmers  
this one whose iridescent wings  
flash in the sun  
and vibrate with each subtle  
puff of wind  
is called the western pondhawk  
her gold abdomen  
says she's a female  
her male counterpart  
being mostly blue  
her outsized eyes  
can doubtless see me  
still she holds on  
to her post  
lets me approach  
to where if she stayed still  
I could reach out  
and touch her  
but I wait  
till she flies off  
a creature from another time  
another world  
descendant of the giants  
of the Permian  
whose two-foot wingspans  
were they still around  
might cause alarm  
brought down to size today  
her nymphs are known  
as naiads feeding on  
the pond's mosquito larvae  
while her kind  
grace our backyard garden  
with their aerial acrobatics  
brilliant colors  
darting here and there  
among the summer flowers
