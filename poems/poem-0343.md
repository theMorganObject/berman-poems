for Loren on her birthday

I can remember  
as if it were yesterday  
that evening in the redwoods  
when the ceremony  
was over and the dinner  
and the toasts  
how you two danced  
more gracefully than any  
of the guests  
dancing in step  
in perfect harmony  
a tango that you must  
have practiced though it seemed  
in every way spontaneous  
you moved together  
with an ease that spoke  
the years already shared  
and augured well  
the life ahead  
a marriage danced  
with grace and strength  
and tenderness  
a gift you two  
are giving day by day  
year after year  
not only to eachother  
but to all of us  
fortunate enough to know you
