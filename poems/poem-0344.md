Today old friends came by  
bringing a watermelon  
sharing the tacos  
that my wife set out  
salsa and refried beans  
topped with tomatoes  
lettuce and the rest  
they brought their son Rahsaan  
a gentle man  
taller than either parent  
by at least a foot  
and also Rufus  
their lap dog  
about the size  
of our cat Ollie  
Rufus barked a few times  
Ollie held his ground  
and all of us moved on  
to better things

Rahsaan showed photos  
of the custom knives  
he'd made since he'd  
embraced the blacksmith's craft  
beautifully formed and finished  
one could feel  
the keenness of the blades  
the artist's eye  
for symmetry and style  
he spoke of his new job  
that has him moving  
up to Portland  
where he'll work  
with children in the schools  
helping them hone  
computer skills

I found him so articulate  
wise in the way  
of young adults  
whose eyes are open  
to the world  
my generation is leaving them  
perhaps it was simply  
a generous impulse  
perhaps some subtle guilt  
knowing he'd face  
a future that I'm happy  
to be missing  
as the family left I offered him  
a bicycle I hadn't taken out  
for several years  
a lightweight road bike  
and was pleased  
when he found a way  
to fit it in their car
