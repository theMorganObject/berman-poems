When I was nine or ten  
we had a boat  
nothing fancy  
maybe fifteen sixteen feet  
a mainsail and a jib  
I don't remember  
sailing in it  
but I do remember  
working with my uncle Hal  
at start of summer  
we'd get the boat out  
turn it over  
scrape the paint  
where it had flaked  
and set about  
caulking the seams  
with oakum fiber  
lengths of rough yarn  
that smelled deliciously  
of pine tar  
seams filled  
we'd work in caulking compound  
and once dry  
we'd paint the hull  
as I recall  
even with all this  
the boat would leak  
so that we kept a coffee can  
on board for bailing  
but the joy I felt  
though scarcely noted  
was working with my hands  
alongside this beloved  
uncle who seemed happy  
to share in the work  
a man that I admired  
for his easy way with tools  
his knowing how to fix  
most anything  
and how to make  
a boat shipshape  
ready to sail  
around the world  
or at least across  
the mile wide tidal  
pond we claimed  
as our lagoon  
and back
