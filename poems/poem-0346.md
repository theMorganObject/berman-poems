for Grace Chu

Globe of honeyed sweetness  
golden yellow  
lustrous orange  
or blood red  
as if the setting sun  
had sent an emmisary  
here to earth  
to fill our mouths  
with solar light  
your color, texture, flavor  
put you somewhere  
between vegetable and fruit  
and sugar candy  
you've earned an honored place  
on tables the world over  
having travelled far  
from your native Andean soil  
in past millennia  
as far as Mexico  
where Aztec farmers  
graced you with the name tomatl  
meaning the swelling fruit  
just yesterday  
my friend Grace Chu  
claiming a glut  
insisted that I take home  
these eight beauties  
now lying in a bowl  
catching the light  
that sweeps in through our  
kitchen window  
eight globes of goodness  
gift of her summer garden
