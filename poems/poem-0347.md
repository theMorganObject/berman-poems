Lover of men  
and gypsy song  
whose verses  
gave voice to the harsh land  
of olive trees  
dry river beds  
the gypsy moon  
the burning sun  
of Andalucia  
you sang the cities  
of the ancient Moors  
Granada, Cordoba, Sevilla  
echoing the ancient Arab poets  
evoking the lost splendor  
of Al Andaluz  
you paid homage to the deep lament  
of the flamenco singers  
and the wounded cry  
of their guitars  
but also you found words  
to catch the beauty  
you saw everywhere around you  
you wrote of sailboats  
gently rocking in the river  
of Sevilla  
city of filigreed towers  
of delphiniums and bells  
and a young girl heading out  
to gather shells and pebbles  
on the seashore

You denounced the violence  
of the fascist state  
the Guardia Civil  
for which they murdered you  
still a young man  
an incalculable loss  
not just to Spain  
but to all of us  
who treasure words  
written in truth  
with a poet's craft  
and with your gift  
for catching all the music  
that's in language  
and making room  
for what imagination brings  
to the table of the artist's task
