It was on the beach at Santa Marta  
a few hours drive  
from Barranquilla where my brother  
lived with Carmen  
his first wife  
who'd grown up there  
that was before my neice  
their daughter Eloisa  
was conceived  
who's now the family scholar  
a professor  
and mother of my brother's  
much loved grandchildren

I'd been snorkling  
along a coral reef  
alive with brilliant reef fish  
spiny sea urchins  
and hearing shouts  
I swam back just in time  
to see some kids  
run off with all our stuff  
my brother's wallet  
his papers, Carmen's purse  
my glasses and the car keys  
and there's Valseir  
my brother's friend  
a fellow teacher  
from the university  
chasing the little thieves  
into the forest  
at the far end of the cove

What he was thinking  
as he chased them  
I have no idea  
wielding a machete  
high above his head  
clearly he'd never  
use it on the kids  
perhaps he thought he'd need it  
to cut brush along the path  
the sight was strange enough  
that we all stood there laughing

We had to hire a mechanic  
to break in  
jumpstart the car  
so we could drive it home  
later I asked my brother how  
the thing had ended  
he told me he'd come back  
after a week or so and paid  
the guy who ran the beach  
to give him back  
his passport and his papers

A few months ago  
my brother called me  
from Sao Paolo  
where he now lives with Lili  
his Brasilian wife  
and mentioned that his old friend  
the professor, Valseir  
who'd wielded the machete  
all those years ago in Santa Marta  
had died  
I never knew the man  
but the image of him running  
down the beach  
without a breath of hope  
he'd ever catch the rascals  
who'd snatched our stuff  
it's a memory  
I'll treasure all my life
