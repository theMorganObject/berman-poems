As we drive up along the crater's rim  
to where the lake come into view  
two hundred feet  
I'd guess or more below the road  
my wife who's been perusing a brochure  
informs me that this lake's the deepest  
in the nation  
that's interesting I suppose  
but I'm more taken  
with the Clark's nutcracker  
whose coalblack eyes watch from the branches  
of a whitebark pine  
rooted in sandy soil here on the rim  
and with the vast expanse of blue  
stretching what seems a mile  
past Wizard Island to the cliffs  
that line the farther edges of the lake  
a skyblue sea set down within sheer walls  
lacking anything you'd call a shore  
its surface shimmering in the mid-day sun  
it's no Grand Canyon  
still the sense of space  
falling away is palpable  
you feel the power  
lurking below the surface of the land  
the violence of the blast that long ago  
created this serene landscape  
of quiet waters with their island  
topped with conifers  
hidden depths left to ones imagination  
a gift of the volcano whose abandoned shell  
now houses this blue treasure
