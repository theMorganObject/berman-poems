Hard to believe  
 so small a thing  
 could cause such pain  
A week I walked  
 on it thinking  
 it was the bone  
But when I twisted  
 round to have  
 a closer look  
I saw a dot  
 of black beneath  
 the skin

I went and got  
 a needle out  
 and dug away  
Though gingerly  
 until at last  
 It showed itself  
I grabbed some tweezers  
 took hold of  
 the little guy  
And felt at once  
 a sense of triumph  
 and relief

My darling wife  
 thought I should try  
 some tea tree oil  
As disinfectant  
 wise advice  
 it stung but so  
briefly that now  
 the bandaid's on  
 my doctored heel  
My foot's like new  
 happy and  
 good to go
