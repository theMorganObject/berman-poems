How far back must I go  
to meet those distant  
ancestors who crossed the lines  
whether in love  
or sexual heat or violence  
and left me  
an inheritance of genes  
from that deep lineage  
we call Neanderthal

No way to know  
what names they called themselves  
or how they looked  
on us their cousins  
who have claimed a moniker  
we've done so little to deserve  
homo/human we share with them  
from the same root  
as humus meaning earth  
but sapiens? not really  
smart and clever yes  
wise hardly  
and while true  
that we've outlasted them  
it's just that we emerged  
much later in the game

What odds our run  
will last as long as their  
four hundred thousand years  
is anybody's guess  
perhaps we'll learn  
from them even  
at this late date  
something of use  
for our survival  
or at the least  
to better understand ourselves  
and to reflect  
on where we've come from  
where we might be headed  
and in the final tally  
what's at stake
