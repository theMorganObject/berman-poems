Was it the beverage itself  
inspired this hymn of praise  
or the conviviality  
of Zimmerman's caf√©  
here are the words  
of the heroine  
a poem in themseslves  
"more delicious than a thousand kisses  
milder than muscatel"  
three times a day  
Bach tells us  
he drank his little cup  
so as not to turn into  
"a shriveled-up old goat"  
I too need my morning brew  
to shake night's heaviness  
though it hardly serves to waken  
creativity the like of his  
and while the Bard reminds us  
that comparisons are odious  
yet it's heartening to think  
that Bach and I  
share even a common vice  
the thought of which inspires me  
to wrap this ditty up  
so if you'll excuse me  
I'll be off  
time for another cup
