The strength of ten men  
scarcely was enough  
when I dove deep  
to meet the monster  
in her lair  
Grendel's grim mother raging  
in her grief  
over the death  
of her misshapen son  
whose wanton acts of murder  
in my mead hall  
led me to end his life  
with my strong hands

Instead of peace  
the mother's wrath was our reward  
and once again it was my place  
to act the hero  
I dove holding my breath  
what seemed an age  
down into her dark cave  
beneath the sea  
there we fought hard  
until my sword bit  
and her blood  
stained the green  
ocean waters red

I had no joy in this  
my heart is ever  
with the pleasures  
of the mead hall  
festive food and drink  
the harpist's songs  
the sweet embraces  
of my queen  
but I admit I'm glad  
that of the two of us  
I was the one who  
made it back to land  
now my men can rest easy  
knowing the beast  
no longer lurks outside our hall  
seeking revenge

I take it as a welcome gift  
and also curse  
this strength  
that makes me first  
among the fighting men  
when battles rage  
then am I Beowulf  
the bee wolf  
one who braves  
the flying swarms  
to steal their honey  
I the great brown bear  
guarding my cubs  
with wild ferocity  
I have that spirit  
for the honey eater gifted me  
these hands and arms  
of more than human strength  
likewise my name  
and I must live out all  
that name intends
