Guarding her web that stretches  
from the fence  
to the clematis  
she's no doubt  
the largest of her kind  
that I have seen

Bright yellow stripes  
across her abdomen  
otherwise black with long  
black legs she's unimpressed  
as I step close to snap a photo  
with my phone

I've read of spiders  
in the Amazon  
for whom even a bird is not  
too challenging a prey  
I'm glad to say  
she's not of that imposing size  
still nothing I would wish  
to tangle with given a choice

Rather I'm happy to concede her claim  
to free range of the garden fence  
hoping that she  
will take up residence  
as tutelary spirit  
of the flower bed  
fierce scourge of flies  
and in the fall  
mother of hundreds  
but for the moment  
she is settled jewel-like  
centered in her thin-spun finely  
woven web
