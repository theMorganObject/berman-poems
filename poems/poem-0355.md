It's been years since I last saw him  
heard his voice  
and here he is on the computer screen  
speaking from the wheelchair  
that he occupies  
as a king might occupy his throne

Talking in quiet tones  
not haughty but assured  
with room for humor  
and an accent that's both subtle  
and endearing  
remnant of his English childhood  
he reminds us  
that the voice of truth  
is not without its charm

His words convey the wise  
and loving teacher that he is  
and has been for so many  
and for so many years  
guiding his students  
toward a more mature  
a truer understanding  
of the path that's under foot  
the work that's here at hand

Behind the words  
a spiritual courage  
that he embodies and transmits  
for all to hear  
courage to live without  
the blandishments  
of easy faith  
of lazy thoughts  
the comfortable half-truths  
that stunt our lives

He teaches that we're living mostly  
in the dark  
that only a rare streak of lightning  
may for moments  
illuminate the spiritual landscape  
that being so  
he himself is like a cloud  
from which lightning flashes out  
revealing worlds  
that we'd been blind to  
landscapes of the soul
