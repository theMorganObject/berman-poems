After the summer thunder  
passed on by  
and the dry wind  
backed off from  
gusting through the trees  
the evening brought a gentle  
shower that lasted  
only long enough  
to cool the air

I watched while clouds  
out to the west  
began a show of colors  
a kaleidoscope of  
pastel shades that shifted  
from pale yellow  
to a salmon pink  
and faded all too soon  
to grey

We took the dogs  
across the road  
down to the little creek  
below the cul de sac  
and heading home the sky  
turned amethyst  
then darkened nearly  
to a velvet black  
the beauty held my gaze  
I stood a moment  
taking it all in  
before going inside
