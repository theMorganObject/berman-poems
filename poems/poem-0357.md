Did you know  
the earth's multi-celled animals  
the worms and beetles  
fishes, lions, bears  
all the planet's beasts  
both large and small  
ourslves of course included  
are outweighed by bacteria  
and their cousins  
the even tinier archaea  
thirty to one?

It seems to be the role  
of science to remind us  
just how little we humans weigh  
in what we call  
the greater scheme of things  
how brief and recent our emergence  
on the map  
how infinitesimal our planet's place  
in a universe of stars whose numbers  
defy imagining

Yet in our bones we know  
no separation  
every distance is illusion  
we are born from stars  
our bodies made of stardust  
we share in the dance  
the pinwheel turnings  
of a hundred billion galaxies  
spinning within the web of space  
that holds us all as one
