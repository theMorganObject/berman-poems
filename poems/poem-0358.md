We've all spent time  
in shadow boxes  
stuck in place  
by some idea  
of our role  
or by some circumstance  
we had no say in  
something that seemed  
outside our control  
look, here's Ken  
sporting his flashy space suit  
an astronaut  
slender and tall  
his arms around his sweetheart Barbie  
naked as the goddess  
astride her scallop shell  
Ken's in heaven till he realizes  
his suit doesn't come off  
Barbie would like to find herself  
some decent clothes  
but it's not the balance between  
over and under-dressed  
the trick is how to leave the box  
move out into the space  
where we're at home  
minus the armor  
and with many different masks  
to wear and different suits of clothes  
to dress in or else happily  
undress ourselves
