Sitting in a rocker  
on the porch that overlooks  
a friend's backyard and garden  
this August afternoon  
my thoughts are soothed  
by the dry heat  
the rustling oaks  
the sound of water  
sloshing in the little waterfall  
my friend has made  
with piled up rocks  
and with a grey ceramic fish  
complete with gills and scales  
and whose mouth spouts  
a steady stream that falls  
into the pool below

The fish seems old and wise  
and I'm reminded  
of the fisherman  
whose nets brought in a fish  
who begged release  
and promised to fulfill  
whatever wishes the fisherman  
might wish

The tale ends with the fisherman  
back in his hovel  
poor as when he started  
having overshot the mark  
asking for more  
than any mortal should expect  
from even a fish as generous  
as this one

For myself there's nothing  
I can think to ask for  
save perhaps another decade  
of passably good health  
and then if possible  
an easy death  
but for my grandchildren  
and for the suffering world  
there's so much more I'd ask  
if such a fish  
should chance to find itself  
caught in my net
