It's late  
the cat's asleep  
here on the couch  
keeping me company  
his belly  
moving rythmically  
with every silent breath

He sleeps curled up beside  
a slab of rock  
with fossils from Morocco  
ammonites with smooth segmented spirals  
and baculites  
ancestors of the squid  
whose long straight shells  
smoothed and polished  
look like darts  
sharp-pointed at each end  
unlike the actual  
open-ended cones  
that held the living nautiloids

A hundred million years  
since these strange creatures  
left their shells behind on some  
ancient sea floor  
the cat's oblivious  
yet side by side  
the rockslab and the  
sleeping cat  
create a sense that time  
is hardly real  
but now my sleepy eyes  
remind me that my bedtime  
is long past
