Such a delight  
to mouth the words this writer  
set so perfectly in place  
his ear attuned  
to write the poetry  
the music  
of his native tongue

Here's his love poem  
for Tamar  
it starts with rain  
that's speaking softly  
letting the poet's lover know  
that now she'll find it easy  
to drop off to sleep

Two lines  
four words  
with quiet hushing sounds  
géshem - the rain  
b'shéket - softly  
akhsháv - now  
lishón - to sleep  
sounds meant to lull  
the lover listening  
to the whisper  
of the rain  
as she drifts off
