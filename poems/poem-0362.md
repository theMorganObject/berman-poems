Fifty-one years ago today  
she left this life  
age eighty-one  
tonight I read a hebrew prayer  
and light a candle  
honoring the love  
that emanated  
from her face  
the kindness that  
she learned from  
old world parents  
rabbi Chaim Elya  
and Chaya Sarah  
Yiddish speakers  
immigrants from Lithuania

She offered me the love  
only a grandmother can offer  
without demands  
or expectations  
a gift I've cherished  
sought to emulate  
with my own grandchildren

Tonight in my mind's eye  
I see her face  
and take some comfort  
knowing my own death  
will soon enough erase  
whatever distances may yet  
lie between us
