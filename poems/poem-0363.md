Other than managing  
the day's demands  
this old man lives  
mostly on memories  
past loves  
imagined conquests  
dreams  
the landscapes  
of his youth  
life's poetry  
and also prose  
the stories he's lived by  
half true half false  
fictions designed to prop up  
the image that he wished  
to show the world

Then there are the moments  
he'd as soon forget  
missteps and mishaps  
life's embarassments  
the same love note  
sent to two girls  
who as it happened  
knew one another and compared  
what they'd received

And there's his work  
his struggles with the world  
the things he's learned  
the years spent  
happily or not  
meeting the needs  
of wives  
of children  
aging parents  
dealings with both friends  
and strangers who have touched  
and taught him  
and those whom he in turn  
has touched and taught

All this is now his treasure hoard  
his sandbox  
filled with a thousand things  
to sift through  
to enjoy again  
in retrospect or else discard  
and if there's wisdom  
to be shared  
to find a way  
this is the work  
he's eager to complete  
before the last sunset  
fades to night  
and every weight  
is lifted from his shoulders
