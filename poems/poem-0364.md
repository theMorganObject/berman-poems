Not that I'm a mouse  
but with my true love gone  
by which I mean my wife  
the house is quieter  
and also safe for me to play  
my louder instruments  
the nyckelharpa and  
the Swedish bagpipes  
known as sackpipa  
not near as penetrating  
as the Scottish pipes  
but too much for  
my sweetheart's ears  
besides I play it poorly  
so that no one  
should have to listen to me practicing  
tomorrow she'll be back  
and I'll put pipes aside  
but while my lovely puss-in-boots  
is off in the big city  
this country mouse will play away  
to my own heart's content
