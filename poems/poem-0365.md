While it lasts let's celebrate the light  
the morning light that streams  
across the valley  
catches the line of mist above the river  
and sets the hills a-shimmer with green fire

The mid-day light that sparkles on the face  
of a high mountain lake  
a gust ruffling the surface  
to a froth of blue sapphire  
studded with diamonds  
tiara of a queen

The evening light that paints the far horizon  
a hundred pastel shades  
pink, green, pale yellow  
shifting to violet  
slowly darkening  
until the sky deepens to indigo

Lights from the depths of space  
the pinprick stars  
and planets urging us  
to contemplate the mystery  
and the soft light  
of earth's lunar companion  
esteemed alike  
by thieves and lovers  
poets  
sailors at sea  
and creatures of the night

First and last I praise  
the light that glows  
like a soft flame  
within my lady's eyes  
whenever love wells up in her  
and overflows  
a healing spring  
yet she would say  
that it's not her  
but passes through her  
from a place beyond this world  
light from the hidden source  
of light and love
