Or are they walking me?  
it's hard to tell  
but anyway we're off into the trees  
that line the little creek across the road  
they're old now  
not the pups they used to be  
but eager still to sniff the woodland floor  
for scent of squirrel  
signs of other dogs  
how would it be to live  
as they do through the nose  
I once came a step closer  
thanks to mushrooms  
the fragrance of pine needles so intense  
it left no room for thoughts or words  
only the smell of pine  
filling the vacant space  
that must have been as close  
as I have come  
to a dog's world  
and still a world or two away  
now the dears are taking me  
back up the path  
with lolling tongues  
ready to head for home
