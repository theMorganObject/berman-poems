Back in the eighties  
she bought herself a place  
up Fickle Hill  
the woman I had left  
my marriage for  
with trowel and spade  
she made a nursery  
devoted to the heirloom roses  
that she prized  
roses with exquisite scents  
and cuplike forms so different  
from their gaudy modern cousins  
and whose names  
I fell in love with  
Blanche de Belgique  
Albéric Barbier  
Königin von Dänmark, Lady Penzance  
Düchesse d'Auerstädt, La Belle Sultane

I've grown some of these beauties  
worked to nurture them  
with moderate success  
here in the backyard garden  
my dear wife has created

The nursery still thrives  
and I am grateful  
for the world of roses  
I'd never have known  
the name proved fateful  
fickle lovers both of us  
after so long surely we're past it  
though it seems  
it's easier to forgive  
someone who's wronged you  
than to forgive  
someone whom you have wronged
