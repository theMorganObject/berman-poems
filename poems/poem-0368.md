Eight feet away  
outside my bedroom window  
a rufus hummer scarcely larger  
than a bumble bee  
sucks sugar from the pink  
and white accacia blossoms  
that perch on fernlike leaves  
flowers like faces  
open to the sky  
each flower a spray  
of threadlike filaments  
hard even to believe  
the hummer's tongue is thin enought  
to reach within and draw the liquid  
that powers her wings  
wings that are flicking faster  
than the eye can catch  
I watch a moment  
take it as a sign  
it's time to shake off sleep  
wake up! she says  
wake up and start the day  
there's no more time to lose  
the honey's in the flower  
the flower won't last  
the sun's above the hills  
before you'd best  
be on your way!
