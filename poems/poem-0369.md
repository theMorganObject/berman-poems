Today for the first time  
in what has been  
almost a year  
I have no poem  
nothing to write that matches  
the anger and the grief I feel  
hearing the news from Afghanistan  
where after years  
of offering at least some protection  
for the country's journalists  
civil rights activists  
political and military allies  
supporters of democracy  
teachers, interpreters  
and above all for the women of Afghanistan  
their right to education  
freedom to dress themselves  
as they saw fit  
their right to equal treatment under law  
all this  
and all these friends and fellow fighters  
for a new order in a war-torn land  
we Americans have now abandoned  
to the Taliban  
whose goal is to bring back  
the medieval rule of sharia  
already they are killing women for their dress  
killing teachers, lawyers, jounalists  
and as their fighters take the country's cities  
I ask how is it that we lacked the will  
to see the thing we started  
through to some semblance  
of stability  
shame on America!  
we've even failed to rescue  
those whose lives are at risk  
for working with us  
shame I say  
shame on us!
