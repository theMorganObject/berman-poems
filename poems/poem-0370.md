When in my dream my uncle Joe  
walked up to me  
his eyes alive and flashing  
with the same wry humor  
that was his gift  
and told me that he wasn't dead  
that all these years  
he'd just been hiding out  
I didn't think to ask him  
all the things  
I wish I'd asked him  
things that I'd be quick  
to ask him now  
he died when I was young  
but isn't that  
so often how it goes  
the questions only come to us  
when it's too late  
when those we loved  
and love still have moved on  
grandparents who would have had  
so much to tell us  
except that we were young  
and didn't know  
the things to ask  
and if we had how much  
of what they might have shared  
would we have understood  
yet of the many things we heard  
and saw when we were young  
there are those  
we come to understand  
only years later  
as life goes on and we  
continue with the work  
of smoothing seams  
aligning colors  
matching patterns  
quilting up the crazy patchwork  
of our lives
