In M치laga we visited Picasso's home  
climbed the stone steps  
of the old Moorish castle  
but of all we saw  
what I most remember  
is the statue  
of the poet Ibn Gabirol  
a jew who wrote  
philosophy in Arabic  
and in Hebrew  
hymns to the Holy Source  
prayers still sung in synagogues  
and dirges  
lamentations for the sufferings  
of Israel  
but also songs  
that gave voice to his earthly loves  
the raptures of his youthful heart  
joyous and free  
praise for the wonders of Creation  
the night sky  
so alive with lustrous stars  
the earth grew jealous  
felt a need to compete  
with fields of starlike flowers

The statue was of weathered bronze  
grey and life size  
the poet as an old man  
with bowed head  
and lowered eyes  
his features narrow  
long robe trailing to the ground  
his right hand hanging  
at his side  
his left arm held  
across his chest  
the hand extended  
from the open sleeve  
fingers wrapped around a scroll  
and on his head  
a turban neatly tied  
he seemed a troubled soul  
or merely sorrowful  
we know he had his enemies  
and reasons  
but what a tribute  
to be so remembered  
after nine centuries  
and long years  
since Jews and Muslims alike  
had been exiled  
from their Spanish homeland  
it gave me hope  
to come across this statue  
raised in honor of  
a son of M치laga  
jewish philosopher  
and poet of Al Andaluz
