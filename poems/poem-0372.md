Here in our library  
I've spent a quiet hour  
with a painting  
by my wife's brother-in-law  
former that is  
almost a seascape  
though the ocean's hardly there  
only a narrow line of grey  
on the horizon

In the foreground  
there's a field of winter grasses  
yellow stalks  
all stiff and fading into brown  
while on the hilltop  
a lone cypress  
scraggly, windblown  
has lost its crown  
there's beauty  
and also a sense of desolation

Slowly the hill descends  
to dull brown fields  
that stretch away  
until they reach the pale  
blue waters of  
a tidal pond that lies  
this side an unseen  
spit of sand

Above the dark line of the sea  
a band of white and  
over that the sky's soft greys  
set off the water's washed out blue

This is a place I've also been  
the headlands of Point Reyes  
where my wife  
and her first husband  
lived as young newlyweds  
close on fifty years ago

For me it's strange  
how much this scene reminds me  
of the fields and the up-island  
tidal ponds on Martha's Vineyard  
where as a boy I spent so many  
wild and happy summers

Taking in the painted landscape  
I feel a rush of tenderness  
both for that boy and also  
for my wife and her young husband  
thinking of their time  
on Point Reyes  
the feelings come on strong  
a mix of gratitude  
and wistfulness  
sadness and happiness running together  
like watercolors blurring  
along the edges
