On the eve of departure  
what you're about to leave  
seems suddenly more precious  
your family and friends  
the house with all that it contains  
of memories and treasure  
and the traces of your life  
like footprints in the sand  
stretching back as far  
as you can see  
now disappearing over the horizon
