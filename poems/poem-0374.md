In spite of years and distances  
it always feels  
like coming home  
and though it's never more  
than a brief interlude  
a week or two  
once I've ambled off the ferry  
filled my lungs again  
with the sweet island air  
walked an hour along the beach  
eyes picking through  
the broken seashells  
it's as though I'd never left  
or rather that some part of me  
stayed behind unnoticed  
awaiting my return
