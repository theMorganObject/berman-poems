Will she live past birth  
past the first days  
the surgeries the doctors say she'll need  
if her heart  
as tiny as it is  
and with its missing parts  
is to keep beating  
if she's to make it through  
even the first few hours  
the first few weeks of life

It's hard to live with just  
the little that we know  
especially for her parents  
who already love her  
to live with the uncertainty  
that weighs  
heavy on each of us  
even as we keep up hope

I have no path of prayer  
and still I pray  
for this small life  
as yet not fully formed  
that she given at the least  
a fighting chance  
to live and thrive  
buoyed up by all the love  
we have for her  
and with which we are ready  
to receive her  
embrace her and surround her  
gratefully and gladly
