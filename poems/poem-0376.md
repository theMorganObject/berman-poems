Here on the island it's almost surreal  
how little's changed  
in the seventy plus years  
I've summered here  
more boats in the lagoon  
the chokecherry has grown  
to where it blocks the view  
the junipers  
by the front door live on  
only in memory  
another generation has arrived  
of grandchildren  
in my case grandnephews  
with fathers from Peru  
and Senegal  
so the family has become less waspy  
than in my childhood  
but the house itself  
now in my sister's name  
is much the same  
with open rafters in the livingroom  
the same sand and dirt driveway  
on rainy days the same  
puddle my grandson played in  
thirteen years ago  
when he was three  
and other than the traffic  
into town  
the crowds of tourists  
filing off the ferries  
the ferryboats themselves  
doubled in size  
little has changed  
myself included other than  
the usual decline that comes  
with reaching nearly eighty years  
and the increasing gratitude I feel  
for all the beauty  
and wonder that surrounds me  
all that's here
