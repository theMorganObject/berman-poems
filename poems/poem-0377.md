At Aquinnah
on our little stretch of beach  
after I'd floundered  
half an hour in the surf  
happily tasting the salt Atlantic  
in my mouth  
I stood there chatting  
with a neighbor  
sitting beside her spouse  
both of them smiling  
clearly enraptured as they watched  
their young grandchildren  
play in the shallows  
I'd been told  
that he was dying  
and to myself I thought  
how wonderful for them  
to have this day  
this time to savor at the last  
the carefree joy  
of children playing by the sea  
the happy cries  
of grandchildren no less  
it's just what I  
would wish upon myself  
and if I'm fortunate  
enough to have a choice  
I'd like to think  
an end like this  
is all I'd ask
