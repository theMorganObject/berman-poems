In the calm before the storm  
wait, isn't that  
a line I stole from Amichai?  
though he, as usual, was thinking  
of his love life  
while I've in mind  
only a quiet day  
on the lagoon  
where boats have come  
to shelter from the winds  
headed our way  
due to arrive  
tomorrow and while for me  
there's no romance involved  
I'm all on edge  
imagining the trees  
whipped by the wind  
the waters all a-froth  
the ocean surge  
a storm that's poised  
to bring back memories  
of island summers  
when a rare hurricane  
made life a great adventure  
for a boy happy to watch  
the grownup world set on its head  
with trees across the road  
boats lifted from their moorings  
the ocean on the verge of taking  
back the island
