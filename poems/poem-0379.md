It's his birthday  
and he's baking bread again  
my dear brother-in-law  
whose knowing smile  
and sense of irony  
might by some be undervalued  
though not by me

These six days past  
he's kept us fed  
with meals that any chef  
would happily pronounce  
la haute cuisine  
he says he does it  
simply for the pleasure  
just as my brother practices  
his clarinet  
and I wrestle with words  
for the pure satisfaction  
I feel when sounds and meanings  
fall in place

But to be fed the way  
that Aric feeds us  
is a gift that brings  
us lucky ones  
who share his table  
higher by at least a dozen rungs  
up the ladder  
that leads to paradise
