Sitting on the deck just off the kitchen  
of the summer house  
here on the island  
the place my grandmother  
the family matriarch picked out  
for her two sons-in-law to buy  
once they'd been back  
a few years from the war  
and there were more of us  
than she and grandpa could put up  
at Phaleron their place a quarter mile  
down the lagoon

Aric and I are talking about  
this and that  
poetry, family, past loves  
how hard it is  
to forgive someone who's wronged you  
and whom you have also wronged  
since as he pointed out  
you first need to  
forgive yourself  
and then ask their forgiveness

Meanwhile from the little cherry tree  
small passarines are flitting down  
to the bird feeder  
my sister's fills with seeds  
the prettiest is the tufted titmouse  
with its soft grey back  
its swept back crest  
and movements quicker than  
my eyes can follow

While we've talked the sky has gone  
from grey to blue  
with clouds on the horizon  
the blue of the lagoon  
shows just above the grassy bluff  
that slopes down to the beach  
only a hundred feet from us  
and now my sister's grandsons  
have returned from tennis camp  
ending the morning quiet  
time to put this piece to rest
