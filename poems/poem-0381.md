Now that I'm in my 70s the wild side  
isn't what it was when we were young  
all it takes to cross that line is walking  
with my sister into Vineyard Haven  
as I did today  
and hearing stories  
things I hadn't heard  
or had forgotten  
the antics of our grandparents  
the things they did  
that were clearly on the wild side  
jealousies and passions  
secret resentments  
kept under wraps for decades  
or hidden in plain sight  
a steptmother whose will was thoughtfully  
designed to disinherit her husband's children  
that is to say my mother and my aunt  
I like to think we grandchildren  
have learned some things  
that our lives are more transparent  
more attuned  
to those of our grown children  
but we've still a ways to go  
before the final curtain  
calls us up for our last bow
