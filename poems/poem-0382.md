of human incarnation  
so much more likely to be born a beetle  
or an ant  
even a jellyfish  
the buddhists say  
that what we have  
was earned through countless lifetimes  
as creatures less evolved  
each one building  
on the previous experience  
and some act of kindness  
a different take on evolution  
to be sure  
though even if the jellyfish take over  
as certain scientists are now predicting  
I doubt that in some planetary future  
they'll be deciphering these squiggles  
these poems written down for the pure pleasure  
of watching words chase one another  
across the white expanse  
of a blank page
