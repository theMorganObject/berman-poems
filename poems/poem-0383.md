This year the little bushes  
off our kitchen porch  
have yielded a scant harvest  
a mere handful  
of the purple fruit  
which like the native fox grape  
grows at random  
in the sandy island soils  
grape sized berries that  
have given us  
in summers past  
a dozen jars  
of deep pink jelly  
translucent  
tart and with a flavor  
like none other  
so that along with bluefish  
and sweet corn  
grown on island farms  
the jelly is for me the taste  
of Martha's Vineyard  
evoking memories of  
childhood expeditions  
to fill our buckets  
and the kitchen magic  
our mother would perform  
straining the sweetened juice  
and once the jelly set  
melting the parafin  
to seal the little jars  
placed in the kitchen window  
so that the sun  
could show the jelly's  
color to advantage  
this year no jelly making  
but the purple globes  
clinging to grey branches  
here and there  
among the leaves  
bring back to mind the taste  
at once both tart and sweet  
like life itself
