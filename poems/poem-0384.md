Not quite the Ithaka of Homer  
or even of Cavafy  
still these summer days have proved  
a homecoming of sorts  
leasurely hours with family  
and with ghosts  
of summers past  
the humid air made thicker  
by the shades  
of those we've loved  
who've gone over the horizon  
to their eternal rest  
and now I'm ready  
to move on  
back to the life I left  
only ten days ago  
with all its shrill demands  
it's busy pace  
but somehow I'm at peace  
as I was not  
before these precious days  
in which old memories  
swirled around me  
a swarm of buzzing bees  
inviting me to feed  
on the rich honey  
of their hive
