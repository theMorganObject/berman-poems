My daughter finally agreed  
to get her vaccination  
after I threatened  
to put on a show  
of fancy dancing  
this from a neighbor  
walking past the house  
this morning  
who went on to tell me  
that just yesterday he'd lost  
a friend to Covid  
Yeah he left behind  
his wife and six children  
such a shame  
so would you board a plane  
my neighbor asked  
knowing it was going to crash?  
clearly a question  
not looking for an answer
