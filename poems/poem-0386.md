I ask myself is this  
the Great Derangement  
Ghosh writes about  
my poems full of birds  
and butterflies  
of childhood memories  
clouds glowing in the sunset  
while every day the news  
grows darker with fresh word  
of how the warming  
of the earth proceeds ahead of schedule  
spawning more catastrophic storms  
more devastating droughts  
worse flooding  
glacial melt leading to ocean rise  
acidic waters killing coral reefs  
the thawing tundra giving off methane  
the arctic sea ice disappearing  
wildfires spread across the western states  
raging in Canada  
Siberia, Australia and Greece  
a daunting litany  
that leaves me wondering  
what poetry can come  
from all of this  
at least the daily effort  
has done little harm  
and tethers me  
to something that seems greater  
and more grounded  
than my fleeting hopes and fears
