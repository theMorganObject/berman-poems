my wife asks casually not waiting  
for an answer  
and it starts me thinking how  
it might be just mud walls  
a thatched roof  
and an entry door  
a hard dirt floor  
such as I slept on  
once near Otavalo  
and that too was home  
to those good folk  
who lived there

a hearth  
a kettle and a cooking stove  
some shelves for clothes  
hammocks to sleep in  
mattress pads or sheepskins  
almost any bed is better  
than bare ground

It may be poorer  
than our house in Oregon  
but it's the same things  
make a house a home  
love that endures  
and memories  
of children laughing  
grandchildren if one is lucky  
and a garden  
hopefully with fruit trees  
(I'll take Santa Rosa plums  
and winesap apples)

Last but by no means least  
friends stopping by  
a pet (or two) for cuddling  
or just to get us out the door  
above all peace within the walls  
peace in the words the gestures  
and the hearts of all 
who share the household's dreams  
and memories  
whose loving ties  
transform a  household  
into what we call a home
