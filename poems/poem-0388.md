(all fall down)

My brother  
who's been living in Sao Paolo  
says that he's grateful  
for the offer  
but my ashes  
might not make it  
through Brazilian customs even if  
he claims they're strictly  
for his own personal use  
though he admits that  
it might still be worth trying  
since smoking them would definitely  
get him high
