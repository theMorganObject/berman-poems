Old friend you stand there leaning  
over the back bedroom  
both spirit of the forest  
and guardian of the home

Your bark grown black and wrinkled  
with the lichen's green overlay  
deep furrows speak of your age  
of wiinters and hard rains

It's seventy years this summer  
since my father bought the place  
you were already a sturdy tree  
though a third your present size

You've lost two of your branches  
sawed off when someone thought  
the roof to be in danger  
the scars show where they cut

Returning again to the island  
as I've done through the fleeting years  
I place my hands on your roughness  
and sense a welcome there

A welcome from one who's stood steadfast  
while I've hurried hither and yon  
such differing lives you and I  
it's reminding me of a song

A song from Argentina  
sung by that country's great bard  
Atahualpa Yupanqui  
his voice and his guitar

His words speak of the sorrows  
that come with moving on  
leaving behind as we all do  
some part of who we are

The tree you have forgotten  
always remembers you  
inquiring of of the night  
are you happy, yes or no

El árbol que tu olvidaste  
siempre se acuerda de ti  
y preguntale a la noche  
si serás o no feliz
