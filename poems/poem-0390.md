sweet poet of my highschool years  
when up was the word  
and Billy the Kid  
fired blanks at Mr Death  
and the world  
grew greener from March  
to the end of May your pomes  
would zing me  
rouse my right of spring  
my lift of love  
my song of every  
wholly and most unholy thing  
since girls and youknowwhat  
were always in my head  
(my heart was still asleep)  
you led me sighing  
on the way  
toward something  
almost sane  
so I say  
thank you
