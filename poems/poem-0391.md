What a shock it was  
at ten or twelve  
to learn that like us  
even the stars must die  
the stars eternal  
yes but only in the sense  
our bronze age ancestors  
allowed the word  
since they well knew  
that no created thing  
could last forever  
but we inherited aeternitas  
rank hubris of the Romans  
whose empire was meant  
to outlast time  
yet far older than Rome  
the word's deep root  
meant vital force  
the energies that play out  
in the earth's great age  
and in the age of stars  
without whose death  
the life we know on earth  
would not exist  
since that same vital force  
with which stars burn  
magnified a thousand fold  
within the furnace  
of a supernova  
makes through its alchemy  
the elements  
needed for life to form  
to borrow from the bard  
stars are in truth  
the stuff that we are made of
