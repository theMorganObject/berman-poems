This year the holidays have come  
fast on the heels  
of summer with its fires  
and with the Covid plague still raging  
no gatherings in our neighborhood  
except on laptops

The Torah reading is the same  
as every year  
although its meaning seems to change  
and deepen over time  
it tells of how the Holy One  
hearing the wails of baby Ishmael  
has sent an angel to his mother  
charged with the task  
of opening her eyes  
"What's with you, Hagar?  
Did you suppose  
that He'd forgotten you?  
Look over there  
the water that you seek  
is right before you.  
You need only reach out  
and fill your cup."

Lifegiving water  
first she gave her son  
to drink and then she drank  
may we too be blessed  
to gaze with opened eyes  
on the world's wonders  
and through grace to find  
that well whose waters rise  
from hidden depths creating  
an oasis in the desert of our hearts
