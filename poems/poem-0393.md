"When you understand that my poems  
 aren't poems, then we can talk  
 about poetry" Ryōkan  
Reflecting on the need to change  
my silly ways  
I think of that dear Zen master  
Ryōkan  
who sang the joy of owning nothing more  
than his old robe and begging bowl  
who wrote in praise  
of plum blossoms  
rice wine and of new love  
that came a winter flower  
and sweetened his old age

Confessing to his human frailty  
he shared his grief that all the years  
of practice  
in the end were no defense  
against the chill  
of autumn nights  
the cold seasons of his loneliness

Coming down from his retreat  
high on the mountain  
he'd dance with farmers  
play games with village children  
his light cast a warm glow  
on all he met  
and through his writing  
and calligraphy  
that light shines still  
I ask myself why not like Ryōkan  
learn to stand aside  
and let the light come through
