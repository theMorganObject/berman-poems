Three boys sit swinging  
side by side in a blue hammock  
laughing and pushing  
eachother for the fun of it  
sons of two sisters  
my amazing neices  
two boys are what we call  
white while one is black

The skin of the white boys  
is less white than tan  
the black boy less black  
than a dark chocolate brown  
strange to think these cousins  
will have such different lives  
if only and in part thanks to  
the color of their skin

The white boys will someday  
be searching for a way  
to introduce their ancestors  
disparate as they are  
Peruvian and Ashkenaz  
and even damn Yankee  
immigrants from England  
from Russia, China and Japan  
settlers from Spain  
and first nation people  
whose ancestors crossed from Asia  
twelve thousand years ago  
but for now this bouillebase  
is content to simmer  
silent on the back burner  
of their young minds

The black boy  
my wonderfully bright  
and playful grand-nephew  
thus far has had little  
to do with the American  
descendants of slaves  
since his father is from Senegal  
while his mother is a mix  
of Jewish and Anglo  
already you can see that  
he's considering the difference  
that makes him unique  
in an otherwse white family  
good that he's so smart  
he has a long way to go
