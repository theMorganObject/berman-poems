In Japanese he left behind  
some fourteen hundred poems  
never collected in his lifetime  
simply handed out on scraps  
of rice paper to friends and folks he'd meet  
who treasured them  
as much for the calligraphy  
as for the poetry  
having read only a small sampling  
I'm almost ready to throw out  
everything I've done so far  
all my heavy-handed efforts  
and start again  
this time trying for a lighter touch
