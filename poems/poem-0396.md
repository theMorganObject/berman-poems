After two weeks sitting in the dharma hall  
with legs crossed  
eyes half closed  
reciting mantras  
I read the little book of Roethke's poems  
entitled The Far Field  
and with each poem  
salt tears welled up  
that was some fifty years ago  
and other than the morning  
that my mother died  
lying on the sofa  
in our living room  
seemingly at peace and eager  
so she'd told us  
to rejoin her husband  
in the world to come  
never again have I been blessed  
to feel so vividly  
quickly and easily  
the feelings that I keep  
safely under wraps
