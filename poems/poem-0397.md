Living through times of war  
this staunch Confucian  
patriot and poet  
said by his own countrymen  
to be their greatest  
Du Fu  
on seeing the destruction  
of the imperial establishment  
the social order  
lamented that only the hills  
and streams  
were still intact  
who would have imagined  
a time like ours  
when the reverse is true!
