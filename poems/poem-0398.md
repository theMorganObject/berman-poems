Last night he came for me  
holding a knife  
or was it an ice pick  
the room was dark  
merely a corridor  
and there was light behind him  
but not bright  
and his features  
they were dark and indistinct  
he came on purposeful  
intent on murder  
I cried won't you stop  
long enough to listen  
or to tell me  
what your reasons are  
but he paid no notice  
standing before me  
arm reaching around  
to stab me from behind  
I cried out loudly  
and woke myself  
it's clear enough  
that someone needs to die  
and someone else  
has come to do the dirty work
