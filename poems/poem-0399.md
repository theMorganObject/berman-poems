Ah says the stranger that I dreamed of  
just last night  
you think yourself so clever  
talking about me with your friends  
writing me into your most recent  
poem as if you knew me  
or the place I come from  
or even who precisely  
is the you  
that I've been sent to kill  
but when you feel my knife  
entering from behind  
and slicing up between your ribs  
I doubt you'll feel yourself  
so clever then!
