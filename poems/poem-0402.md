After backing off so many demons  
it was the Covid got you  
and I didn't know it  
for another year and more  
getting the news only tonight  
via the internet but what's a year  
when it's been fifty years  
since you gave up on me  
at least that's how I saw it  
told me you'd felt slighted  
cut me off  
but in fact I loved you  
though in those days  
it would never have occurred to me  
to say it out loud  
not even to myself  
even if it was for you  
I flew to Tokyo  
and I think you'd agree  
we had some good times  
that year in Japan  
so now it's too late for amends  
and I can live with that  
if only I'd known where to find you  
I did try but dammit  
you were just too good at hiding out
