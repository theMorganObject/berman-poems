Prayer shawl on my shoulders  
prayer cap on my head  
my laptop and the orange cat  
both settld in my lap  
Kol Nidrei played on cello  
a bit longer than I'd like  
the chanting earnest  
but not quite inspiring  
no congregants  
the temple empty  
only the rabbi  
and two cantors  
the rest of us a line  
of tiny faces on the screen  
with Covid it's a brave new world  
biut still the rabbi speaks with warmth  
her voice reaches across the airwaves  
strikes a welcome chord

She says our prayers  
remind us that we're still  
finding our way  
across the Sea of Reeds  
still not done with Egypt  
and the most important thing  
is to keep moving  
not to let ourselves get stuck  
in disappointments or regrets  
or past achievements  
but to let forgiveness heal  
and guide our hearts

Her words about the sea  
leave me with images  
of rising waters  
thoughts of how it's time  
to build our arks  
to save what can be saved  
or else like Jonah  
roused from where he slept  
below deck  
to jump off  
and let the great fish  
swallow us so we can  
come out chastened  
ready to bring the word  
to Nineveh

The prayers are from the psalms  
a mix of comfort and contrition  
preparation for tomorrow  
when we take time  
to commemorate our dead  
then end the fast  
by witnessing the final shofar call  
the blast the rabbis say  
is the primordial sound  
from which all sounds emerged  
as stars and galaxies  
were born from the first  
tiny seed
