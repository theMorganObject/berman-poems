Lime green the rufus  
hummingbird that hovers  
sucking the cobalt blue  
spikes of the sage  
for all that they appear  
black on the page  
how pale these words  
next to the living colors  
that npw have settled  
in the well of memory  
closing my eyes I still can see  
the bright bird feeding  
on the dark blue flowers  
the image lingers  
of a moment past  
now stored for the mind's eye  
as long  
as memory will last
