Dry summer days  
in a dry year  
a dry decade  
here in the West the fires have raged  
these past three months  
smoke in the valley keeps us  
locked indoors  
most days the hills are hidden  
barely visible  
behind their shrouds  
this afternoon while standing  
at the ATM I heard myself  
snap at a stranger  
something I never do  
it seems the heat  
and smoke have infiltrated  
deeper than just my lungs  
tonight the weather channel  
is predicting rain  
starting tomorrow morning  
it's been so long  
all I can bring myself  
to hope for is a sprinkle  
lasting a good hour or two  
but if the rain gods  
whether Thor or Zeus  
or Chacmol choose  
to send us more  
I will make offerings  
and bless the clouds  
that spilled their substance  
on the thirsty earth  
and dance hatless  
and shirtless through the yard  
happy to feel the raindrops soak me  
to the bone
