After the morning rain  
the air's washed clean  
and now it seems the town  
indeed the whole valley  
has drifted off  
into some quiet lake  
or else gone underground  
only from time to time  
the whisper of tires passing  
on the still damp road  
intrude for just a moment  
on a silence  
otherwise complete  
and in the wake  
of today's luncheon  
with a lively company  
I find myself content to be  
at last alone  
that is supposing we  
exclude the dogs  
stretched out asleep  
on doggy beds  
and our wise cat  
who's sitting here  
within arm's reach  
his eyes half closed  
absorbed in feline  
meditation and it seems  
more perfectly himself than I  
have ever been  
except when sleeping  
making love  
or singing
