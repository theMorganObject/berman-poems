Again the cat has captured me  
with his soft eyes  
his steady gaze  
lying beside me on the couch  
taking me in  
with all six of his senses  
as otherwise  
only my wife can do  
one paw stretched out  
claws gentle on my thigh  
purring away  
his head nuzzling the hand  
that I've proferred  
to scratch his ears  
his eyes half closed  
he pushes back  
with such a sensuous delight  
it's hard to know  
how deep his meditation goes  
as for the question  
about dogs and buddha nature  
it's neither here nor there  
as Zhao Zhou's answer shows  
but to my mind  
this kitty's well along  
the path to cat nirvana  
both a loving friend  
a teacher and a comfort  
to my soul
