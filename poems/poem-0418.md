Who but Ryokan could gift us  
with a poem  
subtly comparing his declining body  
and aging mind  
with his beloved walking stick  
he says he doesn't know  
from what past life  
what former age the staff  
was handed down  
but now its outer skin  
has peeled away  
leaving only the true  
and solid core  
and though in youth  
he'd often used it  
to test for deep and shallow  
and so save himself  
from stumbling off the path  
today it leans against the eastern wall  
waiting to help him cross beyond  
this flowing stream  
of time and worldly cares
