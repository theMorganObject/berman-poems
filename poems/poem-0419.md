My friend Bernice  
now well into her nineties  
sits beside me rocking gently  
on the couch swing  
in the back corner of her garden  
I glance up  
and catch sight of a speckled hen  
racing along the road below  
as if just now dispatched  
on a most pressing mission  
hey Bernice I say  
look - there's a hen!  
I know Bernice replies  
she's a real nuisance  
crosses the road  
climbs on my deck  
and I can't tell you  
how many times  
I've had to shoo her off  
Oh Bernice I think  
but keep from saying  
if it were me I'd be delighted  
to have such a bold  
and handsome visiter
