for Robert Ross

My friend has raised this  
as a possibility  
not thinking it's the words themselves  
much less the argument  
rather the healing spirit  
that comes through  
the words and through the mouths  
of those that speak them  
touching the heart  
a spirit neither pious nor impious  
but fresh and joyful  
evoked by the regard  
in which two people  
hold eachother each one seeing  
in the other  
that which is precious beyond price  
the thing my friend  
chooses to call  
the truly human
