Why is it that my wife  
whom BTW I treasure and adore  
chooses moments like this  
when I've just made her supper  
vacuumed the rug and swept the floor  
picked up the kitchen  
put away the dishes  
to tell me how much more  
housework she does  
and how unequal it would look  
if we were keeping score  
I'm sure she's right  
but something in the timing  
frustrates my usual effort not to bore  
her with excuses and leads me  
to vent with this insipid rhyming  
which I vehemently deplore
