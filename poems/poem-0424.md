Our daughter  
now approaching her ninth month  
her circumference nearly doubled  
her face radiant  
on the screen where we have gathered  
for the baby shower  
family and friends on track to celebrate  
with her and with her husband  
their firstborn  
who's scheduled for a landing  
in six weeks

Such joy such optimism  
for a child with only  
reasonable odds of making it  
past her first weeks  
her first months and beyond  
given what the ultrasound has shown

At birth, I learned, a baby  
has three hundred bones  
of which about one half  
fuse early on  
so we adults are blessed  
with just a few  
more than two hundred  
may this precious infant live  
till all the bones  
that need to fuse  
have fused  
and after that  
enjoy long life and health  
and may she be  
a blessing to herself  
and all who come to know her
