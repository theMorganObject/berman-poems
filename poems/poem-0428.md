I've noticed that my skin  
has gotten thinner  
now that I'm creeping up on eighty  
and I bleed  
more easily than just a year  
or two ago  
if it were only physical  
I'd hardly care  
but is it wrong to wish that age  
with its compensatory gifts  
of wisdom and discernment  
might also bring the benefits  
and comfort  
of emotional detachment?
