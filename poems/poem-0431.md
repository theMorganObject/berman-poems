There's still a straggling rose  
flaunting its one last cluster  
of pink blossoms  
as if called upon  
to mark the summer's final kiss

Now with the turning weather  
the chrysanthemums  
have come into their own  
setting the season's tones  
of lemon yellows  
burgundies and pale maroons

The chill October nights  
and rains pose little threat  
to these vigorous upstarts  
glory of the autumn garden  
delighting eyes and hearts

In warmer clothes  
we venture out  
pruners in hand  
ready to trim back  
the summer's wild exhuberance

It's time to clip old canes  
from raspberries and spread  
the load of cedar mulch  
cut back the dangling vines  
reclaim the path  
turn off the summer irrigation  
and bring order to the shed

My wife  
passionate gardener  
invites and urges me  
to share with her  
the pleasures of the garden  
as we work together  
putting it to bed
