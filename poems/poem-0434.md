Is it because once passing through  
I told myself  
this was the last place  
I would ever choose to live  
that this small city has  
through unexpected circumstances  
become my home  
it wasn't the first time  
that I'd said never  
and suffered consequences  
of this kind  
you'd think I might have learned  
but no - I guess  
I'm just too trusting  
and a bit too slow
