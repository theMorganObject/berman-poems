Ten years ago today we flew together  
from New York  
you were already dying  
just shy of ninety-six your heart  
was giving out  
and on the plane  
they told me should you pass  
during the flight  
best to pretend that you  
were only sleeping  
or else we'd have to land  
but you were stalwart  
made it through to Salt Lake City  
and then on to Oregon  
and the next morning  
looking out the window  
from your wheelchair  
at the remnants of the summer garden  
and the passerines  
the titmice, juncos, warblers  
crowding the feeder  
you looked up and said to me  
Oh Stephen, this is perfect! and I knew  
despite the disapproval of your doctor  
that I'd done well to bring you from the city  
to the solace of our country home
