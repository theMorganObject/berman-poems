At times like this when half the world is masked  
and some five million souls sent by the plague  
to Hades  
or to Heaven if you wish  
it's good to have two pockets  
each one with a different message  
the one - it was for you alone  
this wondrous world was made  
the other - you are dust  
the winds of time will scatter  
the trick is knowing  
which pocket to reach for  
at any given moment  
while remembering  
that every moment  
is also a gift
