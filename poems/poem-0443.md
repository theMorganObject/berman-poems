First day in Pittsburgh  
buying stuff for the new house  
no time for poems

Best moment of the day  
the Tuscan white bean soup  
at Zoup's soup kitchen

Everywhere I go  
I hear how families  
are scattered far and wide

In the Ikea store  
of all unlikely places  
a haiku by Basho

The temple bell has ceased  
but the sound keeps coming  
out of the flowers
