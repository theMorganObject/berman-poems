Cruising the narrow streets that wind  
through miles of hills  
above the slow Monongahela  
Seneca for River of Sliding Banks  
the Google Maps lady telling us when  
and where to turn  
we still managed to drive right by  
the little bar and grill  
which once we'd headed back  
and found our way inside  
offered us cheerful hospitality  
with outdoor tables  
a friendly waitress  
and the warm October sun  
Carroll ordered fish and chips  
done to her taste  
I started with a beer  
and found when I got up to pay  
for lunch and all  
a quiet fellow sitting at the bar  
had treated me to that cold IPA  
to welcome you to Morgantown he said  
and so we chatted briefly  
and it seemed that he  
like everyone we've met so far  
on this excursion  
had some way to make us feel a bit  
more welcome  
more connected with the town  
and with the folks  
whose roots are here  
in the rich social soil of West Virginia
