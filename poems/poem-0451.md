Two old horseshoes  
embedded in the sidewalk  
not ten feet from the steps  
leading up to our front door

One of the neighbors  
might remember who set them there  
back when they poured the concrete  
a piece of local lore

Coming home late at night  
I place my feet carefully  
covering the rusty curves  
with my wide running shoes

not that I'm superstitious  
it's just a sudden impulse  
to honor the tradition  
and anyway who knows?
