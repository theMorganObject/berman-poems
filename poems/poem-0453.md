Sleeping in the new house  
new to us that is  
but old  
even older than I am  
by a good thirteen years  
which means it's creeping  
towards a hundred  
so even without Halloween  
we're surrounded by ghosts  
faint echoes of footsteps  
in the halls  
on the stairs  
and the laughter of children  
who grew up in these rooms  
good thing at least our bed is new  
stretching out side by side  
it's like we're cruising  
high above the house's history  
two mariners sailing still uncharted seas
