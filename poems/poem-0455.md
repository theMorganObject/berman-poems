is my father's yahrzeit  
just ten days from now  
in my mind's eye  
I see him as I did for the last time  
lying in the funeral home  
when I reached out  
placing my hand on his cold brow  
stroking his hair  
as I had never once  
done in his lifetime

Today my sister sent a photo  
to my phone  
a poem I had written years ago  
which she had found folded up  
in a wallet that he'd carried in some pocket  
it brought tears to my eyes  
how much we hurt eachother  
simply through our reticence  
the things we could have said  
but left unspoken  
despite all that we felt  
of grief and love
