My friend Elizabeth  
just turning sixty  
has decided to take on  
something her parents evidently  
thought unnecessary  
when she was a child  
the news puts me in mind  
of my own Hebrew name  
Yerachmiel in its Old World incarnation  
(if names can be incarnate)  
and Rakhim  
in more contemporary form  
both from the Hebrew "rekhem"  
meaning womb  
whence rakhaman  
the tender feelings of a mother  
for the child of her own womb  
like Elizabeth I came to this  
my Hebrew name  
later in life  
think of it only seldom  
but it lingers  
in the background  
as a comfort and a challenge  
like the presence of Guan Yin  
goddess of mercy  
whose name I've chanted hoping  
for a heart more open  
more attentive and attuned  
to the world's joys and sorrows
