Who but my friend Daniel  
could have painted  
such a lifelike portrait  
of himself as a young man  
reclining naked in the bath  
and unlike his many paintings  
of the fairer sex in similar  
attire (or non attire)  
this one shows him  
with his privates coyly covered  
with a bathtub toy  
a rubber ducky  
which my wife found so hilarious  
it soon became  
the best joke of the evening
