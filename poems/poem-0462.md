Once with my friend Jess Moon  
I drove a schoolbus  
from Billings Montana  
down through Mexico  
Guatemala and Honduras  
to Nicaragua  
we never would have made it  
without the radiator  
Jess had us install  
in San Diego  
and two spare tires  
both of which we needed  
before the trip was over  
that was back in '89  
our destination  
was our sister city Camoapa  
and we came with books  
medical supplies and seeds  
but the real gift was the bus itself  
although some Camoapan driver  
drunk perhaps  
there was a lot of drinking  
managed soon enough  
to drive it off a bridge  
for me the lesson was it's not so easy  
to be of help  
you have to know a lot  
more than I knew back then
