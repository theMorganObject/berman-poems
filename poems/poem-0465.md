We had some good times  
learning Hebrew  
singing Yiddish songs  
our Polish/Russian ancestors  
were smiling  
our audiences too  
were often charmed  
but love stepped in  
and you were used to getting  
what you felt your due  
so much anger  
when I chose to back away  
later you cursed my marriage  
enough said but still  
I can't help feeling sad  
lifelong friends  
is what we should have been
