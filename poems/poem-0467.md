As the play of warp and weft  
moves toward completion  
the pattern coming ever clearer  
it's the loose ends  
that wait to be tied off  
or simply cut  
so many left dangling  
it would be nice  
to leave a neater legacy  
an heirloom  
for the grandchildren  
but ragged edges  
have their charm as well  
and lives are woven  
of such varied yarns  
often quite mismatched  
let's leave perfection  
to the quilters and their craft
