Let them lie  
the adage tells us  
but they don't just lie  
they twitch and whimper  
in their sleep  
make frightened sounds  
while all four paws  
engage in frantic movement  
and you never know  
if in their dreams  
they are the ones  
chasing or being chased  
and if the latter what  
monster is after them  
I ask myself do wolves also  
cry out in dreams  
or are these nightmares  
thanks to our canine friends' long ties  
with us who also dream  
of chasing and of being chased  
through the unfamiliar forests  
of the dreamworld
