It was so long ago  
my son was three  
the pilot of the floatplane  
let him sit  
up on his lap  
and hold the joystick  
in his hands  
our hostess Dixie Belcher  
brought us out  
from Juneau just to hear  
the Hoonah women sing  
sisters and aunts  
of her adoptive family the songs  
were Tlingit chants  
but sweetly harmonized  
by these first nation people  
like the Russian hymns  
sung in the local church  
even back then it seemed  
to me more dream than real  
the journey to Angoon
