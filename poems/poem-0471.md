For decades now he's sat  
atop my dresser  
the little basket maker  
showing off his wares  
for all I know he's been around  
two hundred years  
seated with legs crossed  
holding up to view  
a fine example of his handiwork  
his smile perhaps betrays his eagerness  
to gain a customer  
his features carved in ivory  
with exquisite detail  
other than memories it's all I have  
from my grandfather's second wife Elizabeth  
companion of his final years  
and whom I loved  
nearly as much as my own grandmother  
it must have been  
the time I'd spent in Kyoto  
that prompted her  
to gift me with this treasure  
I should have asked her  
how she came to own it  
but I was young  
and that was only one  
of many questions  
that I failed to ask
