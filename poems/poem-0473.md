Slowly I move from one shelf  
to the next  
browsing a bit  
among the different categories  
local authors  
children's books  
philosophy  
science of climate change  
gender and sex  
native americans  
and on and on  
so much to know about  
but in the end it's poetry  
that draws me in  
I wonder is it just my short attention span  
or is there something else  
something I need?  
I pass over the fatter tomes  
looking for something  
slender, less intimidating  
Ah! here's one  
Refusing Heaven by Jack Gilbert  
just the sort of title  
I've been hoping for  
glancing among the pages  
I can see this author's been around  
Frisco, New York, Seoul, Perugia  
Munich, the Greek islands and so on  
always questioning the gods  
looking for clues  
to the human predicament  
our loves and lusts  
friendships and failures  
everyday miracles  
he says everything worth doing  
is worth doing badly  
I can relate to that
