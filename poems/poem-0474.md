Talking with old friends  
who've lived for years  
along a quiet street  
out on the Bottoms  
once wetlands then farmland  
thanks to the Army Corps  
protected from the Bay  
by dikes and channels  
aptly named and long since occupied  
by rows of houses  
neither shacks nor mansions  
but solid homes  
now threatend by the ocean rise  
already underway just not quite yet  
the inundation that we know is coming  
in twenty years or ten  
or even sooner  
no one can say for sure  
but what my friends told me  
was happy as they've been  
with where they are  
they've started looking for a place  
on higher ground  
and as I'm hearing this I can't help thinking  
how fortunate are we  
who have the means  
before the flooding starts  
to move to higher ground
