Just yesterday my grandchildren were born  
the twins Kyla and Dylan  
how I love their names  
what of their sixteen years? you ask  
that's their lives  
theirs  
I'm talking about mine  
three times at most I've turned around  
and look! - they're almost grown  
they've still a bit of filling out  
to do but know so much  
more than I did at their age  
still it was only yesterday!
