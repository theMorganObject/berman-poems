for Robert Ross

Was I so drunk I failed  
to recognize my own son's wife?  
I had them think so  
but the truth is otherwise  
seeing her standing at the crossroads there  
her face half hidden with a veil  
I felt for the first time  
how deeply I'd wronged her  
even as I also feared  
for my last son  
and so I chose  
to play along with the charade  
and afterwards gave her the staff  
so she could prove her innocence  
precious Tamar  
now mother of twin sons  
looking back I see it just as one  
more instance of His way  
of playing us  
for purposes eluding our poor reason  
our petty efforts to control the course  
and meaning of our lives  
how vast His heaven  
and how far beyond us!  
even His angels live in ignorance  
of the subtle ways He works His will  
both in the world beyond  
and here on earth  
to imagine we could catch Him  
with our words  
would be to to think that we could hook  
on our weak lines  
the great Leviathan
