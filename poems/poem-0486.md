Abandoned half a century or more  
the house seemed ghostly  
every surface coated  
with layered dust  
old handblown bottles  
cups and saucers lying  
amidst rubble on the basement floor  
a ladder to a second story window  
allowed entrance to the two of us  
both eager  
to explore each empty room  
and just as Nana  
who'd left home when she was twelve  
for San Francisco  
three years before the earthquake  
having said goodbye  
to her beloved cow  
remembered looking up the hillside  
to the village church  
there it was  
framed by the upper bedroom window  
precisely as she had described  
although we felt no urge  
to climb the hill on Sunday morning  
barefoot as she had done  
saving her shoes  
for when she stepped inside
