I doubt it's only me  
who finds these two unlikely  
companions for a morning stroll  
but there they go  
Lucca and Ollie side by side  
tails lifted  
as if it were the simplest  
most common thing  
a Maine coon cat  
a standard poodle  
keeping eachother company  
walking the path below  
our neighbor's house  
where a bit of a creek  
barely a trickle  
flows under redwood trees
