What exactly is the question  
Ponce's concerto  
for guitar and orchestra  
is the answer to?  
I couldn't say for sure  
although I have  
an inkling and I'm certain  
it's a different question than the one  
for which the chaconne  
from Bach's d-minor violin partita  
offers the deepest  
most thoughtful response  
of course it may be different  
for each listener  
but I think likely not so different  
all I know is music answers questions  
that we were unaware of asking  
questions that come straight from the soul  
and for which there are  
no other answers
