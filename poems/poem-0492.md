You shared the long train ride  
with us three foreigners  
north out of Kyoto  
through the February hills  
to Kurokawa where the snow lay piled  
so deep that they'd dug tunnels  
to connect the houses  
that's how I remember it at least  
though it's been so long  
I can't swear to it

We'd come  
you and your friend Monica  
I with my wife Joan  
to watch the Noh plays  
performed by village folk  
in this small farming town  
though not intended for outsiders  
this being Japan  
we were of course made welcome

Of our little group  
you were perhaps the most keen  
since carving Noh masks was your craft and calling  
later I learned you also had a taste  
for Russian songs such as I liked to sing  
and that you had a Swedish boyfriend  
you told me carving Noh masks  
followed strict guidelines  
an impersonal aesthetic  
nothing of your own features  
and this was only difficult  
when the face was someone  
your own age and gender  
then something of yourself  
would show up  
in spite of your best efforts  
fifty years later I still think about  
why this would be so  
and I think also of your quiet presence  
your serious demeanor  
giving way at times to a shy smile  
and I feel a certain sadness even now  
that as with many of the friendships  
that I might have nurtured  
I let ours slip away  
as precious coins might slip  
through clumsy fingers
