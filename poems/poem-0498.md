Two days ago the sand stretched on  
for miles  
cream colored  
soft beneath the feet and deep  
we set up beach umbrellas and luxuriated  
in the late August sun  
watched youngsters playing  
in the waves  
just enough surf  
to draw out happy shrieks  
from grandchildren  
our own and those of other visitors  
come to admire the colored cliffs  
and feel the power  
of this place sacred to Algonquin  
ancestors and their descendents  
the island's Wampanoag tribe

Next day a storm  
the edge of what had been  
a hurricane  
swept through  
and when we came today  
to have a look  
the sand was gone!  
only a five mile jumble  
rocks of every size  
dark brown  
sad sight for those of us  
who would have liked  
to stretch our bodies  
on beach towels and bask  
away the summer's final hours

But as so often  
when things turn upside down  
we've been advised  
another tide will bring  
the lost sand back  
as it does every spring  
so by next summer  
all will be right again  
another reason  
for this old poet to hang on  
perhaps to sleep away  
the winter months  
like the bear man  
he knows himself to be  
then back to bask  
on some soft stretch of sandy beach  
perhaps Aquinnah  
will once more call his name
