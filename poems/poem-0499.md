(in the Yiddish of my Berman grandparents, the name spells Bearman)

This bear man  
that he knows himself to be  
is often a bit slow  
a bit clumsy  
but quick when speed is needed  
greedy omnivore  
he's fond of sweets  
berries, birds eggs and ready  
to brave the bees  
where honey is in store  
posing as a family man  
in truth more loner  
than he admits to  
he'll retreat into his lair  
of private thoughts  
one minute to the next but happiest  
when he can scratch his back  
against the bark  
of an old cedar tree  
a patient fisherman he's not content  
with standing on the bank  
he'd rather wade  
into the shallows  
feel the current  
rush between his legs  
wait for the moment  
when a fat salmon  
swimming within reach  
asks to be flipped  
into his mouth or up  
onto the shore  
the summers are his time  
for foraging  
and fall with it's rich stock  
of chinquapin  
acorns and hazelnuts  
come winter he'll be looking for a hole  
to crawl inside  
cozy until the warmth  
of spring invades  
and wakes him from his dream
