In a side room  
in a corner of the basement  
of the house on Homer Street  
when I was a just a child  
there was a leather trunk  
brown with a clasp  
full of letters  
mailed by someone with a name  
I didn't recognize  
to someone else whose name  
I also didn't recognize  
what drew me were the stamps  
that I cut carefully  
from their envelopes  
and just as carefully steamed off  
stamps from the forties  
when my dad was  
in the war  
who were they being stored for  
all those years?  
I could have asked my father  
was it perhaps  
a war buddy of his  
some soldier  
who had never made it back  
like Jane's father  
the first girl I dated  
of course she didn't mention it  
only later did I learn it  
from my mother  
who had spoken with Jane's mother  
as for the letters  
I never asked about them  
all I wanted were the stamps  
for my stamp book  
where was my curiousity?  
oh I was curious  
but only about such animals  
as I could catch  
and hold in my own hands  
snakes turtles salamanders  
and frogs but never people  
why not people?  
maybe because they seemed  
too hard to catch  
too hard to hold  
in my still childish hands
