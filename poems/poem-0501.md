Junkmail because nobody writes letters  
anymore and haven't for some time  
and bills of course  
for home and car insurance  
property taxes  
city wastewater  
and solicitations from the Democrats  
who have for reasons obvious to all  
who think about it  
fewer billionaires to prop them up  
than their fat rivals in the GOP  
then there's the requests from Amnesty  
from Save the Children  
the World Wildlife Fund  
and fifty other not-for-profits struggling  
to do the work our taxes should be paying for  
or rather taxes that the corporate lawyers  
are paid to shield their bosses' companies  
from having to cough up  
what else? the latest book  
I've ordered from the internet  
which is to say from Amazon dot com  
and sometimes chocolates with benefits  
so I can microdose and see  
with eyes made new  
the magic of my everyday surroundings  
and once a year a check for royalties  
from Harvard Press and my dear father's books  
the ones I've never had the stamina  
to read although in other genres I'm a reader  
that's about it  
god knows how the junkmail  
outdoes the rest by twenty-five to one  
yet I'm ever optimistic  
even eager  
to see what's in the mailbox  
once the postman's come and gone
