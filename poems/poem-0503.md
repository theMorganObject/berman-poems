Meeting again  
although not in the flesh  
still face to face  
thanks to the internet  
it seems that after half a century  
we both can laugh about the way  
our lives came out  
the unexpected interests we shared  
Central America - who would have guessed!  
and how your father  
noted Plato scholar  
may have studied with my great-uncle  
at Robert's College outside Istanbul  
nearly a century ago  
then there were things  
I had no memory of  
but you remembered clearly  
coming to see us up in Humboldt County  
the year my wife was pregnant with our son  
who just now had his 47th birthday  
what I remember is your generosity  
lending me your car when I was desperate  
to get out of the city  
and how I drove from Berkeley  
south to the Tassahara zendo  
tucked in the hill country east of Carmel  
where Shunryu Suzuki also known  
to some as Crooked Cucumber  
was building a stone wall with a few others  
he waved for me to join them  
but I jealous  
of my solitude declined the invitation  
and missed my best  
perhaps my only chance  
for enlightenment  
in those days so much gold  
slipped through my fingers  
not least of all the friendship  
that we might have had  
you and I brought together  
by our mutual friend  
that brilliant and troubled soul  
who's now gone on ahead of us  
to whom you faithfully  
kept reaching out  
kept calling  
even to the end
