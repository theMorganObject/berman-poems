Ties they may be  
but often just a tangled skein  
mostly invisible but strong  
as any silkworm's filament  
they make up the cocoon  
we must unravel  
reeling the tiny fibrils  
into spools of silken thread  
whether to weave  
soft fabric or simply  
to sew up the patchwork  
of our ordinary lives
