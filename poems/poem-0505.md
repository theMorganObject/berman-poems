Especially in winter
when they're dressed  
in somber cloaks of white  
crisscrossed with ragged lines of trees  
brown dots that in the distance  
trail across what seems  
a Chinese landscape scroll  
unfolding scene by scene  
the mountains rising both sides  
of the Interstate  
project a timeless world  
and give the lie  
to the long lines of cars whose drivers  
rushing north and south  
are needing to be somewhere else  
by Christmas eve  
a moment's thought reminds us  
how just yesterday  
there were no cars  
and how tomorrow  
or next week  
when we are gone  
the mountains will have back  
what they have lost  
their solitude  
their stillness and their peace
