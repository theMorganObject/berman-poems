A lighted tree  
but plastic, artificial  
without colored ornaments  
no angel at the top  
the room seems barren  
lacking fireplace and creche  
no figures of the holy family  
or peaceful beasts around the manger  
underneath the tree no presents  
and no children laughing  
running through the house  
perhaps it is this absence  
that has summoned up the ghosts  
the memories long set aside  
that now come floating up  
bringing rich images of times when we  
with all our senses felt the wonder  
the excitement of a holiday  
at once deeply profane  
and deeply sacred  
(though of course we lacked that language)  
when the house was guarded  
by an angel gazing down  
from high up in a tree  
whose needles filled the room with fragrance  
when surrounded by grandparents, parents  
siblings, uncles, aunts and cousins  
we sang Christmas songs and watched  
eachother open presents  
sucked on pink and white-striped candy canes  
and knew that we were loved  
and that we loved our home  
and everyone within the circle  
of our family and  
even if the presents we'd received  
weren't everything we'd hoped for  
there was so much to feel good about  
and no cause to complain
