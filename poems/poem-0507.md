What are they seeing  
these magical eyes  
so alive and so present  
though just a month out  
of our daughter's womb  
they gaze into mine  
as if taking me in  
more deeply than even  
my friends or my son  
or even my wife  
and I know that it can't  
be true but her gaze  
is dark and deep  
as the nighttime sky  
and full of the wonder  
of one who is seeing the world  
for the very first time  
which of course  
is the simple truth
