Snow is falling in the mountains  
falling fast  
the roads are closed  
it's good to sit  
here in Rick's house  
that's Carroll's brother  
Body, his dog, lies at his feet  
chewing her bone  
her Christmas gift  
while Ollie our Maine coon  
venturing out of his retreat  
has climbed the couch  
to lick my ear  
and though the fireplace is fake  
the flames are real  
and the spaghetti sauce we ate  
was the real deal  
so now we can sit back  
and watch the show  
the National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation  
where everything goes oh-so-wrong  
and comes out right  
a thousand belly laughs  
so thank you Rick  
and Chevy Chase for a great ride  
this snowy night
