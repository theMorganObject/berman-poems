was the word  
but that's King James  
the word John spoke  
was λογοσ or in latin  
letters logos which Jerome  
made into verbum  
and Tyndale translated  
to the English worde  
so I ask myself what might  
have fallen out in these translations?  
the Greek logos from the verb legein  
is to speak, to tell, but deeper still  
to gather, to select, to choose, to pluck  
speech as gathering of sounds  
plucked from the mind  
then the Beginning was a gathering  
of proto words  
the atoms, wheeling dust clouds  
that made the first stars  
whose fires forged the elements  
speaking the life to be  
amoebas, jellyfish and salamanders  
mushrooms and redwood trees  
and in time ourselves  
but what of verbum/word? the oldest root  
we know is PIE \*were  
meaning to call, to speak, to name  
to summon forth  
which tells me the Beginning is still underway  
as we begin to name  
the still unspoken world  
we're being summoned to create  
along with what it is  
in us that even now  
is issuing the summons

It is the hypothetical source of/evidence for its existence is provided by: Greek legein "to say, tell, speak, declare; to count," originally, in Homer, "to pick out, select, collect, enumerate;" lexis "speech, diction;" logos "word, speech, thought, account;" Latin legere "to gather, choose, pluck; read," lignum "wood, firewood," literally "that which is gathered," legare "to depute, commission, charge," lex "law" (perhaps "collection of rules"); Albanian mb-ledh "to collect, harvest;" Gothic lisan "to collect, harvest," Lithuanian lesti "to pick, eat picking;" Hittite less-zi "to pick, gather."

verb "a word that asserts or declares; that part of speech of which the office is predication, and which, either alone or with various modifiers or adjuncts, combines with a subject to make a sentence" [Century Dictionary], late 14c., from Old French verbe "word; word of God; saying; part of speech that expresses action or being" (12c.) and directly from Latin verbum "verb," originally "a word," from PIE root \*were- (3) "to speak" (source also of Avestan urvata- "command;" Sanskrit vrata- "command, vow;" Greek rhētōr "public speaker," rhetra "agreement, covenant," eirein "to speak, say;" Hittite weriga- "call, summon;" Lithuanian vardas "name;" Gothic waurd, Old English word "word").
