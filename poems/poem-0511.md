There's my younger sister bending gracefully  
toward the headstone  
Susanna reaching out her hand  
her fingers pressed against  
the chiselled letters  
of our great-uncle's last name

She's standing in what looks like stocking feet  
close by the grave with it's rectangular  
border of stone or concrete  
very orderly  
as befits a Protestant graveyard  
stranded as it were in foreign territory

The grave itself is overgrown with weeds  
but now she's planted yellow mums  
or marigolds  
by the headstone  
nothing gaudy  
just the perfect touch  
to add a bit of grace  
an air of dignity

I can't help wondering who took the photos  
it must have been a friend she's visiting  
in Istanbul  
because there is no mention  
of her husband Ismail  
who I imagine this time stayed behind  
in Izmir

Was my sister thinking as she planted  
the flowers how this man we never knew  
had once been married  
to our great-aunt Anna  
our grandfather's sister  
who had died in childbirth  
long before we came along  
and for whom Susanna  
had been named

so many questions I'd be asking  
this grave's occupant had he not died  
seventy years ago come August  
when I had just turned nine  
but my questions have their best  
their truest answer  
already chiselled on the headstone  
in plain sight  
birth and death and finally the love  
quoting Saint John  
that's greatest of all things  
human and divine
