That's Tricia my wife's sister standing proud  
beside the antlers newly mounted on the wall  
a perfect six-point rack she found while hiking  
the country north of Flagstaff  
shed by some great bull  
they look to be at least five feet from tip to tip  
their almost perfect symmetry is beautiful  
hard to imagine such a massive set  
shed and regrown again, ready each fall  
for the fall rut  
no wonder antlers worn by northern shamans  
Evenki, Tungus and by  
Yaqui dancers here in Tuscon  
help the dancer enter other worlds  
bring news and healing from beyond
