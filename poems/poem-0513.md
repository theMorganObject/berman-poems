How come you got that pouty face  
Bapa Teev? That's Kyla my granddaughter  
fourteen years ago  
when she was two and having trouble  
with her ss's  
to me back then the answer came up easy  
sweetheart it's six a.m.  
I'm not awake I haven't had my coffee  
words that of course I didn't utter  
and just as well  
since now I hear them clearly  
for what they are  
words to defend an affect  
the face I've worn not everyday  
but far too often  
face of a child pouting at the world's  
perceived difficiencies  
supposed disinterest  
and today the question surfaced  
with new force  
perhaps because tomorrow starts a new year  
and I'm reminded of the speed with which  
the days ahead are dwindling  
in number but I wonder  
do I need an answer  
to that question of how come?  
or can I simply choose  
to press the reset button?
