Here on the page before me  
thanks to Hubble  
a photograph of distant galaxies  
a cluster of some dozens  
that appear here as bright circles  
each centered within  
a wider circle  
golden and diaphanous  
the stars innumerable that form these circles  
released their light  
not long after the birth  
of this unimaginably vast  
universe of which our sun is but  
one tiny speck  
that floats along the outskirts  
of a galaxy  
unremarkable except to us  
the one we've named the Milky Way  
the light I'm seeing represented  
in the photograph  
travelled through space  
thirteen point four billion years  
to reach our solar system  
hard to say which is the more astounding  
that depth of time and space  
or our human ability to catch  
this ancient light  
and know what it can tell us  
of our past  
our future and the stuff  
that we are made of
