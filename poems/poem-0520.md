A life some might mistake for glamorous  
the years in Malibu  
the Hollywood connections  
but you were never taken in by surfaces  
and although early on you wrote for Vogue  
it wasn't fashion you were after  
something else  
something truer  
darker and more nuanced  
and so you traced in prose  
our country's underbelly  
and saw prophetically just how fragile  
are the bonds that hold our human world in place  
the ties that keep the body politic from falling  
into such chaos as the violence you witnessed  
in El Salvador  
and then the ways that grief and loss  
when they hit home can change  
the very nature of reality  
as we experience it  
courageously you shared  
with us the blows you suffered  
with your husband's death  
and then your daughter's  
and through it all you stayed the course  
true to the work  
you'd chosen from an the start  
to write with clear unflinching honesty  
the world you found reflected  
in a mind as bright and sharp-edged  
as the facets of a diamond  
goodbye and many thanks Joan Didion
