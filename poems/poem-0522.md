It wasn't Bogart  
slick and sexy as he seemed  
and not Sinatra though his voice  
was gold  
mine was a different music  
not the blues  
however much I grooved  
on Lighting Hopkins  
and not Bob Dylan  
for all his lyrics touched me  
who was it I was trying to become?  
the university professors who had kindly  
taken me under their wing?  
the meditation masters whose smiles  
and gestures changed the world?  
my parents had had their chance with me  
but I could quite manage to be  
my father's son  
in retrospect it was my wives  
lovers and friends  
whose kindnesses  
helped me start to imagine  
the person I'm still reaching for  
the feast that I'm still working to prepare
