My friend sent me a card  
he's doing well  
playing his baroque oboe  
with fellow amateurs  
which is to say with other lovers  
of that rich vein  
that gave us Bach, Vivaldi  
Handel, Telemann  
a host of others  
less known but also gifted  
in the art of counterpoint  
the card he sent  
along with season's greetings  
included wishes for the coming year  
an end to the pandemic and an end  
to Mr Trump's dishonest rant and all the fascist  
lies and efforts to tear down what's shown itself  
more fragile than we'd thought  
our proud democracy  
imperfect but still precious  
my friend had one more wish  
that all the world's nuclear plants be buried  
under Himalayas of concrete  
and what would I  
and maybe you as well  
not give to see these wishes  
come to pass
