Yiddish  
with its typical directness  
(the guy's a crazy shmuck, a real meshuggener!)  
reminds us how it takes a push  
to get things started  
yeder onheib iz shver - every beginning  
is tough  
a comment on the world at large  
but more precisely  
on shtetl life  
the lost world that my grandparents  
came out of  
now our new granddaughter  
at ten days old  
her chest cut open  
the tiny heart repaired  
would seem to be proof  
of the proverb  
yet here she is  
at just eight weeks  
waving her arms  
making contented baby sounds  
and smiling  
as if all things were perfectly arranged  
for her delight  
which is precisely what her parents  
and we her grandparents  
not to mention her amazing doctors  
and NICU nurses  
have been working to achieve  
these past eight weeks  
and yes it's not been easy  
yet the time has passed  
as if no time at all  
and so to introduce her  
to my grandparents  
long since deceased  
but quite alive in me  
I say that she's a wonder  
and a beauty  
with captivating eyes  
a sheyne meydele
