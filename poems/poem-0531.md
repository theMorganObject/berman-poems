After the brief title names the place  
just twenty words  
a quick sketch as if drawn  
with brush and ink on silk  
reminding me  
that you were known  
as much for painting  
as for poetry

a bamboo flute  
 its plaintive voice  
 carries across the lake  
the boat  
 taking your friend away  
 is nearly out of sight  
as twilight falls  
 you start to leave  
 then turn back once to gaze  
the mountain's color  
 fading fast  
 is wrapped in swirling clouds
