Old friend it's now been more than fifty years  
since our paths crossed  
I still remember well  
the Chinese bookstore  
Kyoto 1969  
you've hardly aged since then  
not so for me  
now into my fourth marriage  
and behind me  
the suite of griefs and joys  
mostly the latter  
of family life and friendships  
a career that never quite took off  
and some occasional  
successes in the world  
and through it all  
the words you jotted down  
not exactly on the fly  
but on the many rivers  
your duties had required you to travel  
and that flow and eddy  
through the landscape of your lines  
words that have helped sustain my little faith  
the tenderness with which your gaze once followed  
a trail of blossoms scattered by the wind  
pink jewels lying nestled in green moss  
and how you singled out a spiderâ€™s work  
storm-blown and emptied of its prey  
now holding in its mesh a cluster  
of bright pearls  
the many words you found to speak the world  
that you discovered for us always  
as if for the first time  
and so I write this note of thanks  
hoping to reach you  
across the span of centuries  
to say my thanks  
for the still glowing blossoms  
the raindrops' glitter  
and the midnight drumming  
of rainfall on the river  
that flood of words so resonant  
with the beauty  
and the wonder of it all
