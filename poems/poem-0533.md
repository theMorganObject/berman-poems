I like to think of them as a collection  
something meaningful  
a world of words I've chosen  
to surround myself with  
a house and garden with enough variety  
to satisfy my soul  
but lately what I feel is a reproach  
the way they stare  
down from the shelves  
I've built for them reminding me  
that even if I live  
another fifteen years  
I'll never read them all  
and yet I can't stop ordering  
it's as if by buying books  
I fool myself  
into thinking that I've bought  
the time to read them
