After the rains the river has revived  
filling it's bed from bank to bank  
and calmly gliding  
just down from where we've set  
chairs on the grass  
with wineglasses in hand  
we sit and watch the January sun  
glint off the water  
the current neither fast  
now slow the river seems  
unstoppable in its meanering course  
heading to where it empties sixty miles  
downstream into the sea  
while here it offers  
refuge to a throng of waterfowl  
Canada geese, mergansers  
mallards, green teal  
and look - a bufflehead  
with six small ducklings  
in her wake  
hard to imagine  
ducklings hatching out in winter  
but what else could they be  
these little paddlers  
trailing behind a larger version of themselves  
I suppose because our daughter  
gave birth just two months ago  
I'm more than ever taken  
with the miracle  
however commonplace  
of motherhood  
and so I take this sight to be a sign  
nothing dramatic  
but auspicious for the coming year  
the year now well begun  
with new-hatched life
