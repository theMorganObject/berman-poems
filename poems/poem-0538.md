What if I tell you  
I'm an alien  
from Jupiter's moon Io  
though you nod your head  
you won't believe me  
you'll say I'm crazy  
and I guess it's so

And if I tell you  
that without Jupiter  
this precious Earth wouldn't be here at all  
you will ask me }  
what my sources are } 2x  
and how the heck do I know }

And If I tell you  
that you're the only star  
makes my planets wobble to and fro  
you'll will laugh at me  
while in your eyes I see  
love's embers start to glow

But since I have no words  
to tell you all the wondrous  
things you make me feel  
what say we just kick back }  
take it easy for awhile } 2x  
and watch our garden grow }
