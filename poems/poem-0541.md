It's been years now  
the buzzing in my ears  
soft but persistent  
forcing me to listen  
all the harder if I want to reach  
through it to the other side  
to hear the silence  
that descends once midnight's past  
the house quiet  
and the dogs both fast asleep  
that's well enough  
but when I'm in the mountains  
where the silence is immense  
then dearly I miss hearing it  
without the constant buzz  
which when it first came on  
seemed a betrayal  
even a wounding  
until the thought occured  
that this too is eternity  
as if God were whispering in my ear  
and now it seems  
there's nothing I can do  
to shut that whisper out
