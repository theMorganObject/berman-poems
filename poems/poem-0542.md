Nine showy flowers  
each one bigger  
than my hand  
nine shining stars  
as in a painting by Van Gogh  
a burst of petals  
yellow as a stand  
of goldenrod  
the gallon pot  
is wrapped in foil  
raspberry red  
for my sweet wife  
a birthday gift  
from friends who treasure her  
and on its way  
arriving soon I trust  
a ring with garnets  
tiny diamonds  
in a band  
of rose gold  
a small token  
of my love  
but for the moment  
it's chrysanthemums  
only chrysanthemums
