Here pilgrims stand in line  
to come before la Moreneta  
Catalonia's patroness  
the black madonna  
robed in gold  
with holy child seated upon her lap  
while she holds in her hand  
a globe - the spiritual universe  
she is beyond this world  
although her face seems worldly  
ready to receive our sorrows  
and our heartfelt prayers

Further up the hill  
his name restored to Catalan  
the cellist Pau Casals  
sits with his instrument  
his bow in hand  
the statue's bronze turned copper green  
this native son  
also a patron saint  
if secular and so out in the open air  
while she resides in church  
and behind glass

The patron spirit I came there  
to honor four decades ago  
was also a musician and for me  
a saint of the guitar  
Fernando Sor who learned his music  
here at Montserrat before he had to flee  
from Spain a refugee  
like so many today who've fled  
from war and devastation

The morning after I arrived  
I woke in my hotel room  
to the sound of folksongs  
sung in luscious harmony  
voices of men who in past years  
were students at the monastery  
trained to sing in Montserrat's  
rightfully famous choir  
hearing this happy music  
I sat up in bed and let the sound  
wash over me  
feeling that I'd arrived and found  
what I'd come looking for  
the purpose of my pilgrimage
