Once again the human comedy  
desire jealousy revenge  
murder remorse  
and the familiar warning  
that in holding on too tightly  
to the things we love  
we lose them  
what's lost in this sad tale  
is a dear daughter  
but what makes it different this time  
is the music  
human voices reaching heights  
of tender passion  
expressed in ways scarcely imaginable  
before Italy saw fit to gift us  
with the opera  
and maestro Verdi showed the world  
what depths of feeling  
are revealed when feelings blossom  
into song
