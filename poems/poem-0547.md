Which for me means that I'm off  
the carbs again and aiming for ketosis  
a state just short of sainthood  
or enlightenment  
where the unwanted pounds  
soon disappear  
with scarce a sigh or backward glance  
and the omentum shrinks  
to where I can look down  
and see my private parts  
too long hidden from view  
except before the mirror  
or by strenuously sucking in my belly

And if my efforts find success I'm hoping  
that my heart will also find relief  
so that when walking  
up the hill I'll be less breathless  
lighter on my feet  
the way I felt before the cancer medication  
took away all my testosterone  
but that's just an excuse  
no time to vacillate  
now with our newborn granddaughter  
with whom I feel already  
such a deep connection  
desiring with all my heart  
to watch her grow  
through childhood and with luck  
into young womanhood
