If I hadn't seen it for myself  
would I believe it?  
the ocean's surface  
turned a sheet of gold  
aglitter in the summer sun  
stretching from Menemsha Bight  
to the horizon  
while offshore  
a tall two-masted schooner  
her spars and hull pure white  
but dull against the golden bed  
in which she lay  
in all the years I've walked  
the Vineyard's beaches  
and marvelled at the ocean's  
shifting moods  
its ever-changing colors  
only this one time  
was I gifted with a vision so celestial  
as if transported straight to paradise
