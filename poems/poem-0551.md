A joy to have hands in the dirt again  
knees on the ground  
to dig a bed of day lilies  
stella d'oro - golden star  
I see their blossoms  
glowing in the sun  
four months from now  
but today the feel of the wet soil  
cold to the touch  
is like a breath of mountain air  
bringing up memories  
of summer roses  
columbine  
jasmine and peonies  
the fertile earth  
for all that we have done  
whether from ignorance  
or greed or disrespect  
still is prepared  
to nurture the new life  
the roots and tubers  
the tender shoots and seeds  
that we entrust her with  
her precious body  
pulsing even now in February  
with spring's sweet promise  
with the life to come
