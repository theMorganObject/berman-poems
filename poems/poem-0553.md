These sweet October days  
their unexpected warmth  
after the chilly nights  
the air no longer grey  
with smoke from summer’s fires  
are bringing back old memories  
things long set aside  
now coming to me clear  
as the fall air

A teashop in an alleyway  
Kunming late summer ’84  
with folding chairs set up  
on the sidewalk out in front  
old men sit quietly  
in their dark blue workday outfits  
sipping tea and smoking  
through the impossibly long stems  
of yunnanese tobacco pipes.

Felicia sits beside me  
In the early evening light  
I too sip my tea and listen  
lulled by the soft surrounding voices  
the local dialect that leaves me  
clueless though it must be just  
the stuff of teahouse talk  
anywhere in the world.

And now a surprise  
a young man and his partner  
stand up to perform a song  
from the provincial opera.  
It’s a duet, but they take turns,  
first he to her, then she to him,  
so back and forth, and all the while  
two erh-hu players are twining notes  
in and around the melody

It must be about love because  
it runs the gamut of love’s gestures  
smiles and seduction, betrayal, remorse,  
forgiveness, anger, laughter, tears.  
the audience is amused, is moved,  
cheers and applauds, the couple bow,  
and the old men go back to their tea,  
their pipes, and their games of chess.  
Thirty-four years, and it’s still right there  
clearer than yesterday,  
though unremembered  
all this time  
today it shimmers in my mind  
like a dream, a vision  
another world,  
another life,  
yet mine.
