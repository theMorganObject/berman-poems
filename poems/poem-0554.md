Chestnut Vendor

    Throwback to another century
    	the chestnut vendor makes his way along
    		the cold night streets, pushing his heavy cart
    			crying "amaguri" -  chestnuts hot and sweet!

Cormorant Fishers

    Boats lit with lanterns, the skilled fishermen
    	work lines tied to the rings around their necks
    		keeping the birds from swallowing their catch
    			black birds, black river
    				moonless winter night

The Temple at Midorogaike

    A great carp - blue and white
    	finning in the temple pool
    		"How old?"  I ask. The monk just smiles and holds
    			his hands a foot apart. "When I came here
    				a young man, sixty years ago, already this big."

Obon Festival at Daitokuji

    The festival of souls - let's make them laugh
    	who knows how grim the afterlife might be
      	and so these serious monks are busy painting
        	on paper lanterns the craziest cartoons!

The Buddha's Feet

    At Nara, a great statue of the Buddha
    	Maitreya huge by human standards
    		the toes immense, yet just a miniature
    			when I consider how the Buddha's footsteps
    				span galaxies, reach out across the universe
