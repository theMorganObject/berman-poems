So much to be said for poems  
that end  
in just three lines  
but often I need four  
or five  
and sometimes more

Today it was the masked  
girl in the coffee shop  
her clear blue eyes  
both kind and questioning  
so that I felt my spirits rise

We never fight  
my wife and I except  
over the most trivial things  
what size  
of garden hose to buy  
what color lampshade  
it's as if we found it spooky  
our agreeing  
on so much else  
in fact on almost everything
