Their perky stems for all the world  
like miniature antennae  
five red and yellow apples  
some Dutch master's still life  
sit on a plate whose glaze  
of greengrey celedon reminds me  
of Korean china I saw once  
in a museum  
was it in Kansas City?  
another poet wrote about that glaze  
so restful to the eyes  
a perfect backdrop for the brighter colors  
of the waxy skins  
apples in February - and ripe!  
while just outside the window  
dry brown oak leaves  
flutter in the frosty morning air

poem 559 - Winter Apples

Their perky stems alert like tiny  
radio antennas  
five red and yellow apples  
a Dutch master's still life  
sit on a plate whose glaze  
of greengrey celedon reminds me  
of Korean china I saw once  
in a museum  
was it in Kansas City?  
another poet wrote about that glaze  
so restful to the eyes  
a perfect backdrop for the colors  
and the sheen of waxy skins  
apples in February!  
while just outside the window  
dry brown oak leaves  
rustle in the frosty morning breeze
