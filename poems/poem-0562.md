How strange  
these many years beyond their deaths  
to come upon my parents' wartime letters  
back and forth across the North Atlantic  
this one from October '44  
three months past my first birthday  
to my father stationed somewhere outside London  
my mother sends her love and all the pride she feels  
watching this child  
the first fruit of their union  
running amock ( already) among rocks and flowers  
loving his little cart despite its broken wheel  
and folded in the single page she sent  
a lock not of her own but of her one-year-old's  
blond baby hair  
a tuft transported as it were across the years  
too late for me to thank them once again  
for this great gift  
my human incarnation  
for all the years of nurture  
love and family life  
and their forgiveness as they faced  
their disappointment  
inevitable given the high hopes  
and dreams they had for me  
I hold the hair between my thumb and fingers  
imagining my mother in her twenties  
a radiant bride  
my father in his uniform  
dashing and slim  
his rifle hung behind him  
eyes full of youth's intensity  
and feel my heart  
and throat constrict once more  
with a son's love  
and with a hint of sorrow  
for all I left unsaid and that I'd give  
the world to tell them now
