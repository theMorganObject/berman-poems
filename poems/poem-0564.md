Not quite fifteen weeks  
and look already  
so much expression in the eyes  
such personality  
it seems every emotion known to woman  
man or child  
moment by moment flits  
across her face  
wrinkling her mouth in smiles  
in rage and in surprise  
she has her parents running at her beck  
and call indeed they seem not only willing  
but eager to anticipate her every need  
and all the protean life that she expresses  
so vividly and all the love and care  
surrounding her each hour of the day  
have opened chambers of my heart  
long since forgotten  
and I'm once more a teenager in love
