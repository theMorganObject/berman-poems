How to understand this lyric tenderness  
this stern Confucian magistrate  
so bent on tears  
each spring he's lovesick  
as an adolescent  
only West Lake's lush willows  
quiet waters  
can ease his soul  
like bowls of small bright fish  
his verses brim with flashing moments  
it seems he is forever  
saying goodbye forever  
losing someone dear  
then himself too  
in wine and flowers

So much ink spent  
on partings  
but old friend  
you also know the wonder  
of first touhing  
the drumming of the heart  
as fingers tremble  
unparted lips brush here  
brush there  
eyes closed  
then opened wide  
and shining  
softly shining
