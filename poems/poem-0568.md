until the equinox  
makes Spring official  
though just two days ago  
I was out scraping ice  
from off the windshield  
brushing off the snow  
piled on the hood  
and clearing the car windows

But today the air is warm and fragrant  
with the smell of new plant life  
the pale green willow buds  
look ready to unfold  
and on the highest branch  
of the still leafless maple  
a lone cardinal  
is loudly giving voice  
to his - or is it her?  
need for a mate  
at least that's how it seems  
given the urgency  
and insistence of the call

Though I've seen crocuses  
braving the cold  
that birdsong is I think the surest sign  
that winter's lost its grip  
here in the hills above  
the slow meandering Monongahela
