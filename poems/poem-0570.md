Praise for the one who hears  
and heeds the world's sad cries  
offering the solace of her love  
like children bathed  
in the warm light  
of a mother's eyes  
her love surrounds us  
sooths our restless griefs  
so many names she goes by  
Tara, Guan Yin, Mary  
Sophia and a thousand more  
sister and soulmate  
lover and friend  
mother of all  
for her the jewelled  
galaxies spin round  
like sufi dancers  
with their whirling robes  
and she the central vortex  
sucks the stars  
back in making new worlds  
new universes  
for love  
for beauty  
for her own delight
