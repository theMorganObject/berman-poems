If either of us had been more mature  
we both agreed  
we'd likely still be married  
easy to say  
some fifteen years after the fact  
and maybe true  
but just as possibly  
we'd still make hurtful housemates  
nonetheless she struck a chord  
in me a heady mix of love  
nostalgia and regret  
and with her eyes  
as always so alive  
so calm and loving  
this despite her choice  
to leave for good the partner  
who would not  
could not commit  
I found it easy to imagine re-igniting  
our love except of course we've both moved on  
she leaving the west coast  
and me well settled  
in a marriage  
made as they say in heaven  
so we left the table each one wishing  
the other well  
happy to have acknowledged  
the love we both still feel  
and to be friends  
and knowing it's for life
