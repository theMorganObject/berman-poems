Such an asset to the garden  
our Maine cooncat  
suggesting as he does  
a hint of wildness  
amidst all the order  
my dear wife has worked  
so passionately to create  
you birds beware!  
I've at times found feathers  
on the ground  
clues to a crime I'd rather  
not imagine  
since we love our jays  
our nuthatches our hummers  
but with his tawny orange coat  
there's something regal  
lionlike the way that Ollie crouches  
among the flowers  
his ears bent slightly forward  
catching the least rustle  
in the bushes  
lining the backyard fence  
so still and at the same time  
so poised to leap  
should the least hint of movement  
reach his cocked ears  
or catch his watchful eyes
