I doubt Queen Charlotte knows or cares  
the island's name  
has been reclaimed by the first nation  
natives who have lived there  
some ten thousand years  
in other words forever  
in their art  
and mythic poetry one feels the power  
and depth of a tradition  
formal and classical as our baroque  
or Haydn's string quartets  
a world now mostly lost  
thanks to the smallpox  
the colonial exploitation  
and the onslaught  
of TV and the social media  
but in these echoes  
newly re-imagined  
after the texts Swanton transcribed in 1900  
something surfaces  
as if from the deep caverns  
and swirling currents  
of that world beneath the sea  
where for love and longing  
men and women  
in seagoing canoes of yellow cedar  
will cross the boundaries  
of sea and sky  
moving in realms where killer whales  
appear in human guise  
and dogfish husbands jealously  
guard their abducted wives  
the stories speak a language  
no less powerful  
nor less profoundly human  
than the Greek poet  
with his hero whose tears of longing  
for his distant Ithaca  
his Penelope  
once set in motion  
the course of that great journey of return

Are we literate folk ready at last  
to hear the voices of these Haida mythtellers  
whose words  
a foreign music yet the themes  
however dimly grasped  
are rich with meaning  
an affirmation of what binds us all  
artist and audience to one another  
moved by the metaphors the images  
that hint at something we all share  
of human loss  
the poet's art  
a work of symmetries  
of beauty wrestled with consummate skill  
and care from the great sea of words  
that swirl around our common human griefs
