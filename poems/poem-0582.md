Sitting together in the airport lobby  
after bickering in the car the whole way there  
I said look dear, you chose to marry me  
an older man  
and there are consequences!  
I had been thinking of my thinning hair  
my complicated past that still refuses  
to leave us to ourselves  
my growing sense  
of transience and my own fragility  
So - she responded - am I'm going to get spanked?  
and we both laughed  
moved closer  
let the mood evaporate
