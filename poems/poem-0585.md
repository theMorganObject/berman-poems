Here's a small canvas painted by my great-  
grandmother Caroline  
I think while still a girl although according  
to his scrawl on the backside my grandfather  
thought 1877 to be a likely date  
that would have made her twenty-two  
but my guess is  
it was the year she toured the continent  
still in her teens  
her parents keeping her  
closely in tow  
the painting is remarkable in its precision  
in the foreground a detailed depiction  
of a Swiss chalet  
and then the mountain  
looming huge and white  
beyond the dark green hills  
that slope to a rough V  
just where the valley ends  
still further back another range  
less clearly outlined  
but hardly less imposing  
like a great wave  
that follows on another  
the image stirs in me  
a kind of dread  
like Ahab's whale caught in the act of breaching  
the contrast of the quiet human dwelling  
and the towering white presence  
is too dramatic to be simply beautiful  
it strikes me as an image of the patriarchy  
in a deeply patriarchal age  
and wonder what dear Caroline  
was feeling as she traveled with her father  
the somber Reverend Usher  
through a landscape whose harsh beauty  
and transcendent power  
must have been  
like nothing she had known
