How many poets  
published in our time  
or like myself unpublished  
have taken to heart  
Neruda's recipe  
poems like fresh baked bread  
everyday fare  
to nourish hungry minds  
and souls with words  
that need no higher education  
or complexity of thought  
yet fill the belly and  
delight the tongue  
Elemental Odes - a celebration  
of the ordinary  
things as universal as a pair of socks  
an orange  
a ripe avocado  
or as common  
as sadness or the sea  
even working in a language sonorous  
as Spanish  
to have succeeded as he did  
was no small feat  
and for it he was honored  
but for us who follow after  
it's a challenge  
only a few will meet
