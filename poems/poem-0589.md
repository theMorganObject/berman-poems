Perhaps it's not as Elliot would have it  
the cruelest of months  
I'd save that moniker  
for the dog days of August  
at least out here in  
what we call the West  
where summer wildfires  
have become perennial  
a threat to homes and lives  
and to the natural world  
while smoke keeps us indoors  
weeks at a time

But April for all that she brings  
of flowering plums  
dogwoods in bloom  
and other spring delights  
is bittersweet at best  
though it's not clear  
why that should be  
perhaps it's no more than  
a sweet nostalgia  
for the springtime of our youth  
a feeling I remember well  
but can't revive  
of unrestrained exhuberance  
body and soul coming alive  
along with all of nature  
the sexual juices  
stirring in plants and trees  
in birds and squirrels  
and in ourselves  
as romance beckoned  
from every newly leafed out  
tree and bush  
the quickening of youthful hearts  
April was that  
and for those moments  
of simple joy and innocence  
I would give much away  
though not perhaps  
the wisdom of hindsight  
the years have brought
