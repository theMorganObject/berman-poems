Stafford was her maiden name  
it's over sixty years  
since she found peace  
and a last resting place  
on the island she'd known and loved  
from childhood  
we called it just The Vineyard  
in my mind  
her face is still diffused  
with a soft light  
that spoke her faith  
in God and the hereafter  
though I'd seen a time  
when she had struggled  
long and hard to forgive Him

Today reading another Stafford's poems  
(that's William, not his daughter Kim  
whose poetry I only just now learned of)  
I saw something in his work  
at once hard-bitten  
worldly wise and deeply tender  
that somehow reminded me  
of the grandmother I so loved  
throughout my childhood  
sometimes the soul of sweetness  
other times harsh  
intimidating  
it was she who taught me  
that scrubbing floors and counters  
is a religious act  
requiring elbow grease  
and serious commitment  
when it came to children  
she was a true Victorian  
nothing wild or unbecoming in her household!

While my grandfather was off on the church circuit  
giving talks about the missionary work  
the two of them had done  
in Greece and Turkey  
It was she who  
left behind with three young children  
when the second or third letter came  
from Smith  
offering him a professorial position  
signed his name and sent it back  
and so secured  
the career that took them through  
the Great Depression  
and lasted to the day that he retired

Managing Marian the family called her  
and her dear husband sorely needed  
her strong guidance  
in all things practical  
I loved her for the strength  
that even as a child  
I recognised in her  
but what I most remember  
is the sweetness of her voice  
when she would sing  
out of the hymnal the old standards  
Day is Dying in the West  
Abide with Me  
Fairest Lord Jesus  
and the others  
that we sang all summer long  
on Sunday evenings  
in the livingroom of Phaleron  
their island home  
which was back then  
the house I loved above all others
