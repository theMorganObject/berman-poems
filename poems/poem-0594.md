I remember we'd taken my white canoe  
the inner hull of cherrywood  
to Klamath Lake  
it was in May  
we paddled through the reeds  
with yellow-headed blackbirds  
in mating plumage  
singing from their perches  
on the reedtops  
we had been courting for a year  
and you'd been waiting  
for the divorce to finally be settled  
and I said  
as we lay side by side  
in the grass above the lake  
It's time  
and you knew what I meant  
and the expression  
on your face was unforgettable
