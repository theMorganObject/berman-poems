After a week of rain  
the sun is back  
and I think of the song I learned  
from Belafonte  
when I was young  
a song called Look Away  
Over Yonder  
that was the refrain  
but the verse that I'm reminded of  
as I look out the window at our apple tree  
blossoms already gone but the new leaves  
pale green and glowing  
in the morning sun  
speaks of a lover's smile  
imagined by the singer  
a smile that greets him once he's home  
from his long journey  
his words to her  
will return your glowing smile  
is it her smile that will return  
or the sun smiling  
back on her  
perhaps both meanings  
are caught in that one word  
we speak of light reflecting  
but with love  
we see no mere reflection  
but a world of light returning  
our own light
