Fascism is what you have  
 when the borders between corporate capital and government dissolve  
 Walter Benjamin

Every day a dozen or more messages  
requesting urgently my signature and then  
one more donation because the Senate  
indeed the Presidency is at risk  
if we don't raise as much as our competitors whose billionaire supporters have just put in another hundred million so it seems  
that our so-called democracy is up for grabs  
to the highest bidder while rich folks grow  
every day richer the poor poorer  
are we a democratic nation or  
would plutocracy be more accurate?
