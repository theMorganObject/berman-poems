Setting aside the things  
I only think I know  
there's really not much left  
two plus two equals four  
and certain scraps of memory  
but lately I've been taught  
not to rely on that

There's the meaning of some words  
but meaning isn't easy  
to catch - it's prone to slip  
like water through your fingers  
or like a butterfly  
escape your net

To know yourself is what  
the old Greek sage advised  
but what if there's no self to know  
as Dharma masters teach  
and no knowing as well  
I seem to hear a Zen monk laugh

Yet there is something there  
even Kant gives us that  
and if Laozi is right  
that those who know don't speak  
then I who love to chatter on  
may just as well  
take my seat among the know-nothings  
and so be done with it
