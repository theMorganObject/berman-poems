The fish he has a glassy eye  
he tries and tries but cannot cry  
I'm glad he can't for it's clear to me  
if all the fishes in the sea  
should cry, why then the sea would grow  
and pretty soon 'twould overflow  
and flood the lands along the shore  
and drown the places I adore  
so though the fish may wonder why  
still I'm glad that fish can't cry

Strange that I still remember these ten lines  
from my dim past  
and see in them what I could not  
when just a child  
an eight year old  
how autobiographical  
this little piece of writing  
and how threatening  
the tears I dared not shed  
much better not to know about the grief  
to keep the tears deep  
in the undersea

What was it though, what losses  
had there been?  
was it the world I lost  
when my sweet father  
returned from war  
in nineteen forty-five  
and I just two years old  
was taken from the home  
where grandfather  
had been the only father  
I had known

Till then an only child  
I'd had my mother  
all to myself  
and now a stranger  
had her full attention  
but after six more years  
of family life  
was I still holding on  
to grief and anger from that time  
and what about the feeling  
that the next three children  
were the real family  
that I was the outlander?

I mentioned this once  
to the younger of my sisters  
who said - without a pause  
"We all felt that."  
But I think of the four of us  
just she and I  
shared that experience  
and why we two  
and not the others  
is one more mystery

Now thanks to Disney we know  
fish can cry  
at least on the big screen  
and if the ocean's rising  
that's not the reason  
we can't blame the fish
