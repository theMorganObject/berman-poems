Dear Sylvie,  
Though at present you're too young  
to make sense of this letter  
from your grandfather  
(a title that I claim as the husband  
of your grandmother and as one  
who treasures your sweet mother  
as my daughter)  
soon enough the day will come  
when this letter will be easy  
for you to read and hopefully to savor  
but please don't think I'm writing  
with grandfatherly advice  
an old man's wisdom  
I've little enough of that  
this is only to set down  
a few brief words  
about the joy  
you've brought into my life  
(and of course not just mine)  
in case I'm not around to say them  
when you're old enough  
to take them in

I'd thought by now  
leaning into my eighties  
I knew my heart  
its loves its griefs its moments  
of hard-won equanimity  
and that the passions  
of my youth  
were well behind me  
though the love I've known  
with your grandmother  
these past fifteen years  
has reached the very marrow of my bones  
but such a sweet surprise  
to find myself  
like some teenager falling once again  
in love - a feeling I scarcely remember  
even when my son's babies were born  
By the time you can read this  
you'll no longer be  
the infant whose eyes and smiles  
and gestures have so touched me  
have taught me once again to see  
and feel the urgency of bringing  
our wholehearted efforts  
to the task at hand  
to reach out and grasp  
what's here before us  
to search in eachother's eyes  
for empathy and loving recognition  
to master hands and fingers  
use our legs  
and feet for kicking  
and to find meaning beyond  
all need for words  
learning again each day  
the world was made  
for our delight

You will have no memory  
of these first months  
but I will not forget them  
and if I'm blessed with years  
to see you grow  
becoming ever more yourself  
I have no doubt  
the love I'm feeling now  
will also grow  
and be - I pray  
a blessing for us both
