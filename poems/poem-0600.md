Though this self-proclaimed "peace loving  
country" has been at war  
in all eight decades of my life  
still for the sake of my grandchildren  
and children everywhere  
I now proclaim the victory of peace  
over war and poetry  
over the petty lies of politicians  
and likewise over the great lie of the State  
I sing the triumph of wild rivers  
over dams and parking lots  
triumph of tenderness  
over all forms of violence  
both foreign and domestic
