Today with April sunshine  
pouring itself like honey from the comb  
into every corner of the garden  
the dogwood standing motionless its pink bracts like delicately blown flakes of glass  
the climbing rose exploding with  
five hundred tiny yellow suns  
I felt myself so close  
to being ready  
at last for that leap  
into the present  
no words no thoughts  
just pure sensation
