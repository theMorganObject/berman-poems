East of Green River heading  
toward Cheyenne  
the landscape could be Mars  
save for the greygreen tufts  
of mesquite or whatever desert grasses  
have managed to emerge from the harsh  
rocky soil  
high overhead a contrail streaks  
the cloudless sky  
and then off to the side  
for the one moment  
before I've driven on  
a kestrel hovering  
her pale grey wings beating the air  
other than roadkill  
the only wildlife I've been privileged  
to see  
these last thousand miles
