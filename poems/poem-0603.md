Due west of Laramie  
a broad green pasture  
flanks the highway  
and beside the fence  
a little herd of antelope  
all does I think  
feeding on the new spring grass  
just nine or ten  
I glimpsed them as I drove on past  
at eight-five  
two or three seconds at the most  
their bodies a buff brown  
and creamy white  
their legs as slender  
graceful as any deer  
their heads I hardly saw  
only three seconds  
at most yet even now  
closing my eyes  
I see them just as clear  
as I did then
