Leaving Laramie  
box houses, double-wides  
the usual highway fast food  
and gas depots  
even a Starbucks  
I passed a sign that said  
Sand Creek Massacre Trail  
and remembering something  
of that sad and ugly moment  
in our history  
one more breach of trust  
one more occasion in the long  
centuries of genocide  
still scarcely acknowledged  
much less atoned  
I thought was all that violence only  
to arrive at this?
