Would he have raised his lance  
against these monsters  
these windmills grinding power  
instead of grain  
arrayed across the fields  
a fearsome army  
of towering white aliens their long  
three-bladed swords spinning before them?  
I imagine Rocinante would have turned  
and bolted leaving his intrepid rider  
sitting beside his helmet  
scratching his head  
in his perennial wonderment
