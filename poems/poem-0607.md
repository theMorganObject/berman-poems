Deeper red than any cardinal  
and only half the size  
the wings pure black  
that's what I saw  
as it streaked past the window  
of the porch where I sat chatting  
with my friend Jim Elkins

Elated, I was certain that I'd seen  
a scarlet tanager  
my first except for photographs  
but was it really?  
it flew by so fast it's possible  
I'd merely fooled myself  
since scarlet tanagers  
were on my mind  
my list of sights to see  
in West Virginia  
what I know for certain is  
it weren't no sparrow
