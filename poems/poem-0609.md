Seems only yesterday we drove them  
home from Eugene  
two little puppies  
litter mates  
just eight weeks old  
one white one brown  
how quickly and  
how easily they won our hearts!

That was twelve years ago and now  
they're two old dogs  
still playful  
not as bouncy  
hips arthritic  
eyes turned milky  
and already we've begun  
to grieve their passing  
knowing they will leave behind  
a space that nothing else  
will ever fill
