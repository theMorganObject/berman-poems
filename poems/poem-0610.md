(after Wang Wei)

The baby safely strapped  
into her daypack  
rides on her mommy's chest  
her daddy leads us  
along the trail that climbs  
up through the newly  
leafed out maples  
the wet ground is carpeted  
with club moss while the thorny  
vines of greenbriar  
hang from the the lower branches  
and purple violets stud the forest floor  
reaching a rocky overhang we gaze  
far out over the river winding off  
into the distance flanked by the steep  
slopes of the Alleghenies  
despite the name no snakes  
although it's May the nights  
and mornings are still too cold  
for them to venture from their crevices  
how sweet to have this Mother's day  
with my dear wife  
our daughter and her husband  
and our granddaughter  
if it's not Heaven  
then Heaven must be  
just over the next ridge
