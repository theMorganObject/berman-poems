When faith in your ancestral gods has vanished  
 so totally that nothing is left in its place, not even an  
 aching void ... Gregory Vlastos - Plato's Universe 1975

What is that aching void our scholar speaks of  
as if from personal experience  
did he himself lose faith  
in Luther's enterprise  
and so choose Plato's cosmos  
geometric and rational  
but sacred nonetheless  
the work of a Creator who absconding  
has left us here  
to work things out as best we can

Or was he giving voice to a deep sense  
of what was lost  
when Plato banished poets  
from his city  
along with all their host  
of gods and goddesses  
naiads and dryads  
guardians of sacred springs  
and groves  
all the wonders Ovid worked  
so artfully into his Metamorphoses  
without whom we who followed  
might have found ourselves consigned  
to raise our children on scripture alone  
or such thin gruel as Euclid  
has provided with his geometric proofs
