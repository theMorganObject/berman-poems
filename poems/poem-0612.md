Thunderheads advancing almost stealthily  
from the northwest  
just enough wind to set the sumac branches  
swaying and the maple's new leaves trembling  
the air is dense  
heavy with the promise  
of rainfall soon to come

With evening almost here  
the shrill discourse of starlings  
robins all the feathered tribes  
seems to intensify  
as if the avian constituency  
needed to comment  
on the waning light  
the looming weather

From my high perch on the veranda  
I look down  
toward the Monongahela  
moving just out of sight behind the trees  
and shops that line the banks  
a muddy river flowing slowly north  
to join the Allegheny  
the Ohio and at last the Mississippi  
and the Gulf

The scene below is motionless as if  
frozen in time  
save for the slow advancement of the clouds  
my lungs take in the Appalachian air  
fragrant with mock orange and lilac  
the heady mix of herbs and flowers  
that sprout in every corner  
with each breath I feel my mind  
descending deeper into freefall  
no thoughts, no desires  
only the peace suffusing  
all I see
