The two old dogs on leash  
the morning coffee  
avec croissant  
still a sweet memory as we walk  
across the road into the cemetary  
a forest of grey stones  
stand in the new-cut grass  
like sentinels on watch  
and look! here is the grave  
of Waitman Willey  
1811 he was born - the man for whom  
our street was named  
also the legal document  
renouncing slavery  
which allowed this parcel of the Alleghenies  
to separate in 1863  
becoming the new state of West Virginia

And here are stones to honor the descendents  
of Colonel Zackquill Morgan after whom  
the town is named  
in 1772 he settled here  
after him came what might be termed  
a motley crew of settlers  
land speculators among whom  
George Washington was eager to invest  
along the Ohio but here the land  
along the slow Monongahela  
was less profitable  
at least until steam engines  
and the rise of mining  
and even then the coal  
was mostly south and west  
but here the gravestones  
speak of waves of immigration  
Scotch-Irish, Welsh, Italian, German, Greek  
along with good-old Anglo-Saxon names  
a reputable crew - no evidence  
that they took up moonshining or  
joined in the feuds  
of such folk as the Hatfields and McCoys  
at least that's how I choose  
to think of these quiet folk  
now housed beneath the stones  
that guard this grassy ground
