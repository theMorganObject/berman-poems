When the beliefs of our ancestors no longer resonate,  
 what's left is animism - incoming student Peter Boodberg answering to a UC Berkeley dean ca. 1920

You see, this little puffball  
of a planet  
our mother Gaia  
whose living skin we cling to  
as moss clings to oak  
is suffused with what the Greeks  
called anima  
the stuff of soul  
or if you will a radiance  
an aura  
as real and as substantial as a rainbow  
that's most likely to  
while walking forest paths  
or beside alpine lakes but may also  
in the wonders of a backyard garden

In their primordial beauty  
even the glacial rocks and streams  
will pulse and quiver  
with inner life  
sending out waves that resonate  
like sympathetic strings  
sounding deep chords  
within our human hearts
