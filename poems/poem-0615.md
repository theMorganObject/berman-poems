after Buson

    	Sylvie at six months
    		half asleep in her stroller
    			sultry spring afternoon

    	Sitting with new friends
    		enjoying our cheese danishes
    			the rain still on its way

    	Got here just in time
    		to score the last three croissants
    			the baker's specialty

    	Sylvie all bright smiles
    		performing for these strangers
    			a star in her own show

    	Walking back uphill
    		Carroll pushes the stroller
    			while I dawdle behind
