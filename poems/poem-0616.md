I hear him hammering away and look  
there he is in the thick ivy  
that's circling the oak  
outside our door  
a species we don't have  
back home in Oregon  
so he's my first  
though not as big  
as the great pileated  
but to my eyes still  
an impressive specimen  
the zebra stripes across his back  
set off his cap  
a striking red  
while the belly that he's named for  
is hidden by the vines  
as I come closer  
he ducks behind the tree  
avoids my gaze  
without allowing me to interfere  
as he drills holes  
to hide the nuts and seeds  
that come next winter  
he'll be busy digging out again
