Even the little town of Hinton WV  
till recently well off the beaten path  
with its brick pavements  
its marble monument  
to the Confederate dead  
historic houses and its wealth  
(some would say surplus)  
of churches  
boasts a coffee shop with every possible  
espresso drink  
lattes to order  
soy, almond or oat  
whole milk or two percent  
for better or for worse it's the arrival  
of the National Park  
and tourists like ourselves  
come here to hike the trails  
or fish for bass  
or just to photograph the falls  
and so for luck the town  
has something old  
(the hills, the river)  
and something new  
(the Park, the coffee shop)  
something borrowed  
(that would be our brief time  
on the planet)  
and for something blue  
the Bluestone Lake will do
