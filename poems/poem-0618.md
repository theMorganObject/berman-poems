A mile and more along the Fern Creek trail  
the two dogs at our side  
or scampering off  
into the underbrush  
we come at last  
out to a rocky outcrop  
a viewpoint  
sheer cliffs that fall straight down  
a thousand feet  
to where the river winds its way  
through the wide gorge  
black vultures circling in graceful arcs  
above the river far below  
off in the distance  
the great arch of the bridge  
with cars and trucks  
like Lego toys cross slowly  
back and forth  
the sense of space  
so vivid and the air so palpable  
as if it might support us as we leapt  
off the cliff's edge  
to join the vultures  
in their soaring flight
