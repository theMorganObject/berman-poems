Time was there was no time  
only a blur  
of shapes and colors  
faces - some I recognized  
and many I did not  
if there was time  
it was a bubble floating  
with me inside it  
mostly sleeping  
or else watching  
as light and shadow shifted  
things came in and out of view  
to my bewilderment or else delight  
mostly long forgotten now  
still I can close my eyes  
and that lost world sometimes appears

In time I moved through hours of endless play  
and learning  
every day lasting as long or longer  
than a month of today's days  
no sense of flow  
only the isolated moments  
minutes, hours  
each one quite round and self-contained  
and bumping up against the next  
like numbers on one of those  
new handless clocks

With adolescence time became a torrent  
sweeping me along  
a giddy swimmer  
working just to keep my head  
above the surface  
while what I thought was the real world  
rushed past  
not quite within my reach

Now as I approach  
my ninth and likely final  
decade here on earth  
the dramas of the past seem  
as if played by someone else  
another actor  
perhaps my understudy  
while I sat watching from the wings

But these past weeks  
this sweet time with our granddaughter  
not quite seven months old  
I'm starting over  
learning from her as she shows me  
the effort that's required  
to be present  
with all five senses  
eyes wide open  
ears alert  
mind taking in the world as it unfolds  
moment by moment  
nothing held back  
she's pure attentiveness  
this baby zen master  
a joy  
to feel her joy  
to let her hold my finger  
 in her tiny hand  
to watch as she  
loudly proclaims her needs  
insisting on her place among us  
like some baby bird  
that cries time and again  
I'm here I'm here!  
how laid back and lazy  
how half asleep  
I feel when she's awake  
observing me  
with those eyes fresh with wonder  
and delight  
or disapproval as the case may be
