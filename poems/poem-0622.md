Come look! my wife said  
so I came and stood  
beside her in the kitchen  
as she stared out  
into the darkness  
of a moonless night  
her eyes following the dim line  
of the bushes  
that edge the yard  
I followed suit  
and then I saw  
what had excited her  
the tiny sparks of light  
lasting just long enough  
for mind to register

Taken by surprise  
it was a moment  
before the light of memory dawned  
yes, fireflies  
I'd known them in years past  
one time in Kansas  
they lit up a whole field  
and often on the island  
of my childhood summers  
I'd caught them  
kept them overnight in jars  
but that was another lifetime  
scarcely remembered  
tonight the sight was magical  
and for a moment  
I was a child again  
feeling the wonder of it all
