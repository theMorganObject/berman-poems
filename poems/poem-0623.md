Named for the Lovings  
she a black woman  
and he a so-called white man  
married in the state of Washington  
arrested in Virginia simply by reason  
(if that's the word)  
of their differing race  
that was in '58  
it took a Robert Kennedy  
and Warren's court  
to strike down the state laws  
making such marriages a crime  
that was June 12 of 1967  
more than a century  
after the Civil War  
yet three more decades passed  
before the Alabama courts  
were brought in line  
now every day there's news of the resurgence  
of white supremecy  
the Proud Boys and their ilk  
and what lies hidden in the words  
let's make "America Great Again"

Last week in Fayetteville  
"Coolest Small Town" in West Virginia  
we met by chance a fellow Democrat  
a lawyer who from youth has been  
active in politics  
he told us since Obama  
that his party has held little sway  
my wife asked "is it just racism?" and he  
pausing a moment, answered kindly  
"Ma'am?" as if to say  
you folks from Oregon have no idea!  
it was a poignant moment  
at once funny  
and unforgettable  
today I'm wishing him every success  
our lives and our democracy  
depend on it
