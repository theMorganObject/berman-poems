After the fall  
when blood kept dripping  
from my head  
and all that I could manage  
was to sit in shock  
there on the concrete steps  
Lucca came over and began to lick  
the sticky red stuff off my hair  
my neck my hands  
it felt so touching and so tender  
those few moments of being cared for  
by one who'd always looked to me  
for reassurance  
his dark brown eyes searching my own  
with such concern it was  
as if I'd made it to the other side  
and he were there  
gone on ahead to welcome me
