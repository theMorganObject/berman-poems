In my imagination I can see  
a hell designed expressly for those five  
whose title "justice" now seems so misplaced  
who by this latest act have undermined  
what little still remained of public confidence  
in a High Court chartered to stand above  
the politics of parties and of factions  
and so a precedent  
that saved so many lives and was  
relied on by men and women both  
for fifty years is now thrown in the trash  
I see these so-called justices  
consigned to hell - all five now female  
desperate to terminate  
their own unwanted pregnancies  
but barred by laws that they themselves  
had helped legitimize
