Rice planting maidens  
in robes with crimson sashes  
enter the paddy fields  
with their arrival winds  
of love and longing  
blow out across the paddies  
thereby assuring  
abundant harvest  
all this the poet  
seems to take for granted  
focusing instead on the carved  
boxwood combs  
they've placed in their coiffures
