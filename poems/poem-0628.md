At seven months my granddaughter  
already knows what fun  
is to be had in bonking heads  
at least with those of us  
she recognizes  
mom and dad  
and grandmama and me

I'm more than glad to offer  
my old pate for her to bonk  
since it's a game  
that causes her to squeal  
with pleasure  
taking me with her  
for a moment to  
that place of pure delight
