After such violence  
lightning flashing all around us  
thunder rattling the windows  
our two dogs  
trembling by the bed  
the whole house seemingly unmoored  
as if a ship at sea  
an old time schooner  
riding out a midnight storm  
and now the morning calm  
a stillness punctuated only  
by an occasional birdcall  
while a grey mist  
obscures the range of hills  
lining the far side of the river  
that flows north  
a quartermile below us  
out of view

Looking out on the still morning  
it's as if the storm  
has left a hole in time  
put everything on hold  
awaiting a clear signal  
for the day to start  
resume the usual sounds  
of passing cars  
pedestrians walking their dogs  
children at play and  
oak leaves rustling  
but nothing stirs and time seems paused  
as if in shock  
and still recovering from the night's commotion  
an intimation of the moment  
after death  
when time has fled leaving eternity  
to fill the void
