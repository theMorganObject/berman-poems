We named it Harber  
for the Harlows and the Bermans  
bought in the forties  
when my dad and uncle Hal  
returned from overseas  
and soon there were  
too many grandchildren  
for my grandparents  
to put us up at Phaleron  
their summer home

My grandmother picked out the house  
in point of fact  
a cluster of small cottages  
just a five minute walk along the bluff  
and from the kitchen porch  
a view of the Lagoon

A sandy path that sloped through huckleberry  
and scrub oak down to the beach below  
soon became delightedly familiar  
to my bare feet  
grandma offered to loan her sons-in-law  
the necessary cash  
four thousand dollars

Seventy-five years later  
with Phaleron long since sold off  
the Harber property  
is worth perhaps a million  
gone to my sister and her husband  
the only ones of us  
who could afford the taxes  
and that with renting out the place  
part of the summer

When I was in my teens I learned  
the little cottages  
that made it so convenient  
for our two families  
to come together  
june through august  
year after year  
had been a brothel  
owned by a Jewish madam  
who whether thoughtfully  
or simply honoring some family tradition  
had affixed a small mezuzzah  
to the kitchen door  
nearly painted over I can see it still  
although my sister  
years ago replaced it with another
