Two weeks to the day  
since diving off  
the concrete steps and headfirst  
onto the pavement  
I'm thinking of the mantra  
that my friend recites  
though sometimes  
so he told me  
fails to honor  
no going down the stairs without a hand  
clasping the bannister  
ah yes  
the bannister of life  
I thought as he relayed  
this wisdom and I saw  
the coming years as stairways leading  
sometimes up othertimes down  
but all supplied  
one hopes, with bannisters  
to lean against  
steady oneself now that the sense  
of balance has becjome precarious  
and more critical than ever  
until at last one reaches that high landing  
where neither stairs  
nor bannisters are needed
