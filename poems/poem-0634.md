urges the poster on the door  
as I wait here at the dealers  
for the shop to finish  
with my oil change  
and I imagine it means  
no making love  
until you've made your money  
Money First, Lovemaking Last  
how to else to understand  
the image of the pricy Subaru  
that is the poster's centerpiece
