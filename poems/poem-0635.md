Eighteen-o-three  
that's when George Dorsey bought  
the property  
that's now a city park  
the highest point  
for miles around

Looking to the west a crazy-quilt  
of hills and valleys line  
the Appalachian plateaus  
eastward off in the distance  
the long contour of Chestnut Ridger marking  
the Allegheny's western edge

The knob - a dark grey mound  
of compressed sandstone  
topping the hill  
has held out  
since the Pennsylvanian  
three hundred million years  
before our time

A scattering of visitors like us  
relax here in this green  
and peaceful setting  
we're not the first  
paleo hunters came to share  
these hills with mastodons  
saber-tooth cats  
some nineteen thousand years ago

Fast forward there were folks here farming  
corn beans and squash  
laying out villages  
six hundred years before Columbus

Today the air is still  
the quiet scarcely broken  
by the steady whoosh  
of cars off in the distance  
the chattering of cardinals  
of robins and occasionally  
a catbird

Along the path a sampling of wildflowers  
but the jewel of the morning  
is this spicebush swallowtail  
who skitters through the shrubbery  
alighting for mere seconds  
black wings fading  
to pale blue  
the margins punctuated  
by white crescent spots  
a clear reminder in this place  
of ancient memories  
that beauty is a creature of the moment
