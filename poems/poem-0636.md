Ignoring Euclid and the wise counsel  
of my dear wife who thoughtfully  
suggested staggering the tiles  
I trusted my own eyes  
and so of course  
reaching the middle row I lost  
the perfect lines  
I had been reaching for  
and yet the overall layout  
pleases the eye  
so I console myself  
with knowing that the porch itself  
is far from square  
and with a welcome mat  
before the door  
that opens on our livingroom  
no-one but me will notice the small  
if irritating consequences  
of my inexpertise
