Eight months  
and bouncing in her grandmom's arms  
our Sylvie reaches out  
two hands  
ten tiny fingers  
to grasp the shiny tuners of my uke  
while I strum a calypso beat  
and sing the songs  
I learned from Belafonte  
back in the fifties  
Jamaica Farewell  
Come Back Liza  
Matilda  
while Sylvie kicks with  
unabashed delight  
the sweetest audience  
an old musician such as I  
could ever wish for
