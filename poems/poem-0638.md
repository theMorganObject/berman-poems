Two days into my eightieth  
year my sisters  
brother, cousins all alive  
and well only a few friends  
having gone on ahead  
to scout out the unfamiliar territory  
she showed up in my dream  
a woman whom I'd never  
seen before and yet  
her face her voice seemed somehow  
familiar and I said you're beautiful! and she  
said I know! and we agreed  
it wouldn't become sexual  
just loving friends  
me being so much older  
and married besides

This morning when I close my eyes  
her face is there  
still lovely still compelling  
and I hope we'll meet  
again because whatever  
and whoever else she is  
she is an emissary  
of the soulworld  
the underworld of dreams  
here to remind me  
to honor and embrace  
my own mortality  
and with all my heart I thank her  
for her gift
