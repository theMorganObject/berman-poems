Eighteen-sixty  
some curator's guess  
neither the artist's name  
or village known  
the braids of human hair still lifelike  
despite the years  
her face seems real as yours  
or mine  
or even more so  
black eyebrows arch  
like osprey wings  
red crescent stripes  
on cheeks and brow  
lips parted in what's  
neither frown nor smile  
nor yet astonishment  
dark eyes though open wide  
look mostly inward  
she could be twelve or twenty  
but her expression  
far from childlike  
suggests the shock  
the grief that you or I  
would also feel on witnessing  
our world destroyed  
our people dead and dying  
family, friends, whole villages  
lost to the new diseases

From each braid hangs  
perhaps by way of signaling  
her status or her clan or both  
an eagle with eyes staring out  
and wings outstretched  
at this remove I have no way  
to know if she seemed beautiful  
back then or merely sad  
the way she seems to me

And was she carved to sell  
or meant for dancing  
in some solemn ritual  
I have no clue  
still she touches me  
deeply and would do so  
though I were ignorant  
of her provenance  
such is the carver's art  
the voice still speaking  
through the mask
