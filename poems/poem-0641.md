Cruel the god Apollo  
who gifted you with vision  
then bestowed on you the curse  
never to be believed  
the future you foresaw  
better not to have known it  
your brother Hector's death  
at grim Achilles' hand  
your city sacked  
her soldiers slain  
her women carried off  
as spoils of war  
you yourself raped then taken  
to serve king Agamemnon  
and along with him  
killed by his murderous wife  
and so the gift itself  
believed or not  
would have been its own curse  
no wonder you retreated  
into madness whether real  
or just pretended  
and yet I choose to see you  
not as victim  
despite your undeserved fate  
rather to praise you  
first for your strength resisting  
the god's unwanted favors  
no small thing turning away a god  
and then even while knowing  
you would not be believed  
for struggling fiercely  
to alert your countrymen  
as to what lurked  
in that accursed horse  
brave Cassandra  
we need your vision and your courage  
to shout the truth however hard  
it falls on unaccepting ears  
now that the fate of more  
than just our cities  
is at stake
