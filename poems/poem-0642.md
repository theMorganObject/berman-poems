Perched on the wooded ridge  
above the river  
the sun sinks slowly  
it's glare muted  
by the trees  
the cloudforms shift  
white islands drifting lazy  
in a pale and waveless sea  
for a brief moment sunset colors tinge  
the edges of the clouds  
then all too soon  
only the west is still aglow  
the rest has faded  
as darkness settles in  
leaving the hills marooned
