In 1918 - year of the pandemic  
that took my grandma Emma's sister Jennie  
Carl Jung forsaw and prophesied  
the next upheaval of the German psyche  
Siegfried's return  
the violence that would erupt  
two decades later  
no-one believed the Swiss Cassandra  
and while he was spared  
the death that was her fate  
how many others proved less fortunate  
not even counting the six million  
of the Holocaust

He died in nineteen sixty-one - it's now  
sixty-one years since he passed over  
into that great beyond which he  
a grandchild of the gnostics recognized  
as the Pleroma  
the wars go on  
and other voices prophecy  
but none with deeper insight  
into the human soul  
than Dr Jung
