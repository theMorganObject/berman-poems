Often the words you chose  
dance on the page  
paying tribute to your gift  
and to a lifetime  
spent practicing the writer's craft  
but in the end  
it is your passion that comes through  
your love for all that lives and makes  
this planet earth  
even today  
even despite the degradation we have wrought  
in a few brief millennia  
command our reverence  
and curiosity  
our efforts to come out  
as you did  
out of our narrow lives  
to meet the world's strangeness  
and beauty not just halfway  
but with our whole and open hearts

You wrote of wonder  
to be found everywhere  
we turn or take the time  
to let our eyes  
light on the mystery  
the beauty that surrounds us  
in whatever place  
or circumstance we find ourselves  
even in cities  
beauty and wonder that your words  
gave voice to as few others
