Looking out across the bay  
the oyster barges  
grey, homely, nondescript  
yet by their presence  
bridging a bit the distance  
to Eureka with it's sketch  
of city structures while the rest  
of what lies here before us  
is bereft of any human artifice  
mudbanks and picklegrass  
and the still waters  
of the estuary at low tide

The quiet is impressive  
so we speak  
my son and I in undertones  
he sharing what he knows  
of oyster farming  
while I ponder the name Ma-le'l  
what might it mean and how  
pronounce this Wiyot word  
from an Algonquian stock  
shared with Arapaho, Ojibwe  
Shawnee, Cree  
tribes that all lie off at such a distance  
one has to wonder by what route  
the Wiyot came here  
and how far back in time

If you asked the Wiyot elders  
they might say it was back when Raven  
using his crooked beak  
cobbled together this lumpy  
bumpy world  
(he'd tried to make it smooth  
but being Raven soon  
ran out of patience)  
and our ancestors  
they'd rightly claim  
being among those first to find  
their way to Turtle Island  
chose these quiet waters  
you call Humboldt Bay
