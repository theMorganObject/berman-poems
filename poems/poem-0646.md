My heavy ryebread loaves  
two bricks the kitchen knife  
can barely cut  
how is it they again  
refused to rise?  
I followed all the steps the recipe  
laid out  
at least the middles are still moist  
and the molasses  
paired wonderfully with lemon zest  
and fennel  
sliced thin and toasted  
dabbed with clover honey  
the taste and texture well repay  
the effort spent mixing the sugar  
salt and flour  
kneading the dough  
waiting for yeast  
that friendliest of fungi  
to do its work  
(it did do some)  
the good news is  
hard as they baked  
these loaves should last far longer  
than storebought bread  
I'd give them each  
a week at least  
and maybe more
