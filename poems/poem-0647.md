This gentle monk  
who chose to live apart  
from temples and monastics  
choosing instead the company  
of villagers and most of all  
of children in whose games  
he loved to join  
has left a list  
of thirty-seven things  
to be avoided  
while engaging with our fellows  
whether friends or strangers  
young or old  
each of his precepts  
suggests a deep awareness  
of how we mindlessly abuse  
the gift of speech  
each one points to the possibility  
of a more mindful  
more enlightened conversation  
hence nothing ostentatious or competitive  
no showing off ones knowledge  
no name dropping  
or long windedness  
affectation or condescending smiles  
rudeness or fancy words  
the list goes on  
if sometimes I remember not to speak  
more than I should  
and to make space  
for someone else's words  
then I've come closer  
to what Ryokan's wisdom  
points toward
