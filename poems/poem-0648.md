What poet has evoked with such relentless  
and tender passion every physical  
nuance of love and loving  
all the many women  
whose breasts and thighs  
and sex he celebrates  
making of love a ritual repeated  
with the same serious intent  
as when at Yom Kippur  
the chazzan chants the Kol Nidrei  
or as in ancient times  
the high priest would place loaves  
upon the altar  
and once the god had tasted  
and departed  
that same sense of fulfillment  
and of loss  
the grief of parting  
sadness of something precious  
that cannot last  
runs like a current  
through the poet's lines  
even as his lyrics sing  
the joys of loving
