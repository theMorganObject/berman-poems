Time in the garden
perhaps the sweetest gift  
of my old age  
considered time well spent  
although I realize  
I'm doing little for the larger world  
pulling weeds and pruning back the roses  
hand watering the blueberries  
the fig the lemon tree  
this morning  
the air fresh after the first  
light rain of autumn  
it was the flowering quince  
that called for trimming  
seeing how its height  
had nearly doubled while I was away  
only the dark green leaves  
not a trace left of the blossoms  
that delighted me  
was it last April  
the month escapes me  
but the soft coral of the petals  
is fixed in my mind's eye  
as fresh and lovely  
as any sunrise  
in the youthful spring
