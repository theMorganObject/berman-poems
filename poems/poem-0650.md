This ram's horn  
bought in Eretz Yisrael  
twenty-six years ago  
chosen for its dark wrinkles  
and its heavy weight  
there in the outdoor market  
of Tzfat where in another age  
two luminaries  
of the mystic path  
known as kabbalah  
Luria the Lion  
and Moses Cordovero  
brought forth a light  
whose glow down to this day  
suffuses Jewish prayer and piety

Tonight remembering the holy men  
and graves of Tzfat  
I raise the shofar  
to my lips and as there issues forth  
the blast which is to all  
the other sounds as white light  
is to all the rainbow's colors  
my dog begins to howl  
as if remembering a time  
when he was wild and free  
once more the wolf  
that was his ancestor  
and so we harmonize  
in our unearthly chorus  
old man with his old dog  
discordant voices joined  
to break the old year's fetters  
and welcome the new
