A fisherman
who looks to be  
even as old as me  
the distance  
makes it hard to tell  
stands in the shallows  
there on the far side

Flyrod in hand  
sun hat  
tan hipboots  
shirt of faded blue  
I watch as he pulls from his reel  
a length of line and casts his fly  
dropping it midstream  
where the current's strong  
he lets it drift  
then jerks it back  
from time to time

No strikes but still  
the late September air  
is crystal clear  
the sunlight striking sparks  
that dance and dazzle  
on the river's back

Fish or no fish I like to think  
that he's a happy man  
this fisherman  
like me  
just happy to be here
