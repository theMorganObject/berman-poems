Here on this quiet pond the little  
woodducks are the shyest  
quickest to paddle off  
at my approach  
is it because they know their feathers  
are the finest of the bunch  
their patterns most appealing  
to our human eyes?  
and is this what makes the coots  
with their dull plumage  
happy to ignore me?

Mallards too  
are paying scant attention  
as I scan the shadows  
on the farther shore  
hoping to glimpse again  
the woodducks' elegance
