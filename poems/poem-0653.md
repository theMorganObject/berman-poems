Spring of '62 we took the train  
to Kiev - me and dad  
leaving mom back in Moscow  
with the younger kids  
after a Russian winter  
Kiev (as we spelled it then)  
seemed light and airy  
a welcome lift to my gloomy  
adolescent spirits  
(I was eighteen that year  
and rather lonely)

I remember how the Dnieper lay  
below the city  
a dreamy blue and on a streetcorner  
I bought a book of gypsy tales  
first told (as I imagine)  
in the gypsy tongue  
to wide-eyed children  
seated beside their elders  
at night around a campfire  
then someone made a version  
in Hungarian and from that came  
the book I bought in Russian  
with a fair sprinkling  
of gypsy words

These were stories unlike any  
I had read before  
stories of how the gypsies  
came to be the wanderers  
the outcasts of the world  
tales such as Why Our Lord  
was Nailed upon the Cross  
with just Three Nails when it was  
Customary to use Four  
it seems the only blacksmith  
that the Roman soldiers  
could persuade to forge the nails  
was a poor gypsy  
who while knowing it to be a sin  
feared for his life and for his family  
and the fourth nail?  
refused to cool and still lies  
somewhere out there  
glowing like lava in the dark

At times I miss my father and I grieve  
for all the talks  
the heart-to-hearts we never had  
but now with Putin  
and the war in Ukraine  
I'm grateful that he's not around  
this man whose life  
spanned two World Wars  
who with the Second  
saw first hand the human costs  
the waste

A surviver  
he chose for himself  
as if a sacred task  
the work of finding common ground  
calling himself a friend of Russia  
and the Russians  
though not their system  
and so this criminal aggression  
with its retinue of suffering  
and its betrayal  
of all he'd worked for  
could bring him only grief

Once when he was eighty-five  
I asked him  
dad aren't you ready to retire  
and he replied "I count on dying"  
when four years later  
what he'd counted on  
took him from us and from his work  
it seemed I think  
to him less a relief  
than a rude interruption
