Two old dogs  
one genuinely canine  
one only a cur at heart  
have left the car below  
are trudging up the packed  
dirt logging road  
that starts beyond the gate  
cloth bag in hand  
the so-called sapiens comes  
with mushroom feasts in mind  
chanterelles would be perfect  
but the woods are dry  
no rain and so  
nary a shroom in sight  
still and all the dog's  
good company and on both sides  
the cedars add their fragrance  
to the sweet October air  
while from the forest leaf litter  
sword ferns are brandishing  
their green and lustrous fronds  
meanwhile further along the road  
the dog is waiting patiently  
for his too slow companion  
to catch up
