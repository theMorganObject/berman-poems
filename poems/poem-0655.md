Lonely is what each of us has felt  
if not now  
then at some moment past  
but here's the paradox  
since it's impossible  
to free ourselves of voices  
not our own  
or memories of being touched  
or touching  
never are we truly alone

And with apologies to Donne  
even the islands  
rising from their common source  
whether volcanic  
or tectonic will of necessity  
share the journey of the seabed  
they ride upon  
as on thermal currents  
the subocean plates  
are pushed and pulled along

And like islands that while joined  
on the seafloor  
and connected by the flow of ocean currents  
yet stand apart  
we too may know ourselves  
to be alone even surrounded  
by our families  
our friends and loved ones  
is it true then what the rabbis  
have long taught  
that we bear some essence of the one  
whose spirit is in all things  
yet of all things  
is most alone?
