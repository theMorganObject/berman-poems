Non-natives yes  
but I can't think of California  
without their sickle leaves  
whose pungent smell  
speaks of the many places that  
I've known and loved  
along the coast from Del Norte  
south to Mendocino  
past Santa Cruz to Big Sur  
and Los Osos

Brown strips of bark that hang  
in tangled clumps  
leaving the skin bare  
smooth to the touch  
the aromatic fragrance brings back memories  
of sunshine glinting off the blue Pacific  
magical summer days when I was new  
to California and in love  
with every hidden beach  
with every trail that lead to

This morning at my son's place overlooking  
Humboldt Bay I gaze out through the window  
at the long and slender eucalyptus limbs  
like naked arms  
that stretch up out of sight  
beyond the windowframe  
reaching high into the grey October overcast
