It's different from a year ago  
when we'd just started  
to move in  
fixing the toilets  
refinishing the floors  
not yet knowing  
how long we would be staying

Now that it's settled  
and December we'll be leaving  
it's as if our suitcases were already packed  
and we two standing  
one foot inside the house  
the other out the door

Now comes the hard work  
letting go of all the things  
we've loved about the place  
the house itself  
the friends we've made  
the neighbors who've reached out  
sharing their stories  
their laughter and their warmth

Though from the start  
we knew it would be temporary  
still it's harder than we thought  
this slow goodbye  
I see it as another chance to practice  
improve our game  
be ready for the finals
