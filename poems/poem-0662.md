Last night's snowfall  
has left a thin white blanket  
across the neighbors' roofs  
and icy patches in the grass  
beside our porch  
while out my window  
thick on the limbs  
of the young trees  
dead leaves hang curled  
like paper cutouts  
more pink than brown  
against the light grey overcast  
they tremble in the gusts  
that shake the branches  
of these slender oaks  
that though asleep  
yet hold the promise  
of another spring
