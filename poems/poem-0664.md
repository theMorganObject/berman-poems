the morning before Thanksgiving day

Hillbilly music on the radio like nothing  
you would hear back home in Oregon  
and we agree - my wife and I  
we're going to miss the local accent  
not quite deep south but just different enough  
to remind us folks here seem less hurried  
happy to stop and chat with you  
as they walk past your house  
or on a streetcorner  
downtown or in a coffeeshop  
like the Blue Moose
