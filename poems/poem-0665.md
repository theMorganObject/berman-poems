Perfect even in death  
this waxwing lies  
not yet rigid  
who knows how she died  
perhaps she froze  
in last night's cold  
or hit a window  
no sign of injury  
tips of her tail  
brushed with bright yellow flecks  
wings with a sprinkling  
of vermilion  
eyes forever closed  
that yesterday were quick  
her body quivering  
with aerial life  
now she grows stiff  
her beauty testament  
to the Creator's unerring eye
