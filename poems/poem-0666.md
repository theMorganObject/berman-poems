Below my window  
past the parking lot  
the slow Monongahela flowing north  
towards Pittsburg  
surface barely rippling  
in the breeze  
on either bank denuded poplars  
limbs twisting wildly  
bright against the river's dark  
I think of Washington  
surveying for the Brits  
just 60 miles downstream  
where the Mon meets with the Allegheny  
to enter the Ohio  
(good spot for a fort  
young George determined)  
and so these waters  
moving beneath my window  
reach at last the Mississippi  
then the Gulf  
a world or more away  
from where I'm gazing out  
on this November morning
