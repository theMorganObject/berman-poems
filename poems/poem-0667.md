Colonel Zackquill after whom  
they named the city  
his father being Colonel Morgan Morgan (unlikely as that sounds)  
fought alongside General Gates at Saratoga  
in 1777 and lost half his men  
but won distinction nonetheless  
so I guess there's always something  
to give thanks for  
though the Seneca  
living here centuries before Zackquill  
or General Gates  
and who gave us  
the name Monongahela  
for the river's sliding banks  
might well feel less inclined to celebrate  
the national turkeyfest
