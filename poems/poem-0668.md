What do they see  
these soft brown eyes  
that gaze so intently into mine  
do they see what I've not yet found  
in a lifetime's searching  
does this sweet canine friend  
detect what I've only known  
in the eyes of others  
the sparkle and flash of love  
the soul's hidden depths  
the awakened mind  
empty and clear  
stretching forever  
enfolding all things  
and what of the question  
in Lucca's gaze  
is it the same as the one I ask  
each time I search my lover's face  
whose eyes speak worlds  
beyond all knowing  
bringing me back  
to the one place  
where I'm truly home
