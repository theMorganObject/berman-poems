Coming back from Brooklyn on the plane  
the stewardess whispered to me if she dies  
on the flight don't tell a soul  
make like she's sleeping  
otherwise we'll have to land

Next morning when I wheeled her  
into our livingroom  
where she could drink her coffee  
and watch little birds  
outside the window at the birdfeeder  
she turned to me and said "Oh Stephen  
this is perfect!"

Her heart failing  
she tossed about most of the night  
Dr. Hull kindly agreed to see her and prescribed  
morphine which I placed with an eye dropper  
under her tongue  
next morning she made the transition  
and I've had to wonder  
did I kill her? was it her time  
or did I rush things?

In the four years since my father's death  
she'd been waiting to rejoin him  
her best friend and lifelong partner  
hoping that he was behaving himself  
there on the other side  
(for who knows what temptations might await  
a soul unused to living on its own)

After a week my sister called to tell me  
she'd heard from mom  
through the celestial wireless  
or what our family calls "table tipping"  
the message was that all was well  
Your father loves Me!  
the table tapped out  
that was more than a decade ago  
and it's been good to know  
that mom is home again
