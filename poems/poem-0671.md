Just two doors down  
my friend and neighbor Mr Elkins  
with whom I share a deep concern  
one could say love  
for storytelling and (I might add)  
a decent glass of wine  
tells me how growing up  
in rural west Kentucky  
his family lived for a time underground  
sharing the one room basement  
of the home his father would build  
once he'd acquired the wherewithal

It's funny - Jim told me  
I don't remember much  
about the house  
after we finally moved in  
but those years of living in the basement  
though I was just a kid  
those memories have stayed with me  
all this time
