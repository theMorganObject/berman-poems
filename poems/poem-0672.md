His dear body  
stiff this morning  
the smell of death  
already oozing  
from his mouth his orifices

I laid him in the woods under a deep  
blanket of leaves  
a heavy log placed over them  
December runoff trickling close by  
perhaps he'll decompose there  
where he lies  
before the critters find him

Always I'll remember and miss most  
the softness of his gaze  
his look still somewhat shy  
and questioning  
even with all the years  
we'd known eachother

In my mind's eye I see him chasing gulls  
and sandpipers along the shore  
skirting the water's edge  
barking his wild excitement  
fast and free  
a blur of brown against the sand  
the sea and sky
