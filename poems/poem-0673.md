Now that we know the distance  
to the stars  
have counted up the trillion galaxies  
whose jewelled pinwheels  
spin in the blackness of space  
with an ethereal beauty  
whose light has travelled  
through a depth of time  
that reaches back  
to when the universe had only  
just been born

And now that we know the elements  
that form our bodies  
flesh, blood and bone  
were forged deep in the hearts  
of dying stars  
how is it we can be so quick  
to go to war  
over some bit of this  
precious blue puffball  
it must be we've forgotten  
where we came from and where  
our journey home will take us  
at day's end
