In fact it wasn't shabbos  
but in the dream as I was walking  
just two houses down from where  
our daughter's staying with her husband  
and their baby girl  
through a glass door  
I saw some young men dressed like jews  
either orthodox or possibly hassidic  
so I knocked and stepped inside  
to ask if they were getting ready  
for shabbat and they said yes  
and when I asked if I could join them  
they said sure  
but only if I passed a certain test  
a sort of oracle involving the same door  
that I'd come through  
although the way they went about it  
wasn't clear but anyway  
I passed the test

Then all at once the rabbi  
stepped into the room  
wearing a robe with gold and purple  
looking rather like a priest  
a little older than the others  
he was on another level  
in his spiritual practice  
but not distant  
rather warm and welcoming  
he started singing  
a sweet niggun and his voice was beautiful  
so I joined in  
adding a higher harmony  
to my surprise I knew the tune  
I thought we sounded good together  
but then wondered if I wasn't  
somehow overstepping  
so I stopped and told the others  
I should go now  
it was time to call my wife  
and that I'd stopped by  
only to find out if this was a place  
where I could celebrate shabbat  
and they invited me to come again  
the next Friday and with those words  
the dream came to its end
