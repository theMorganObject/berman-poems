Our neighbor and dear friend  
surely in shock  
though managing to mask it  
beneath her usual composure  
a scant three weeks  
since her husband's death  
so unexpected  
only weeks away from his retirement  
and now this lovely woman  
joins us at dinner  
sharing slices of fruitcake made  
with her own hands  
putting us at ease with easy laughter  
and thoughtful words  
and once again I'm struck by the resiliance  
the courage and high-mindedness  
we humans often manage to summon up  
when following a bitter loss  
the soul reveals its depths  
its strength and powers of healing  
such was the gift of grace  
and graciousness  
our friend brought to the dinner table
