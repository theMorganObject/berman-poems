Cold and clear today  
the hills beyond the river  
leafless trees  
a soft brown blur  
under a pale blue sky  
and just a trace of yesterday's  
snow on the ground

Christmas lights and Santas  
of every size  
take over after dark  
but at our house we'll light  
five little candles  
four for the fourth night  
one the shammas  
or "sexton" that we use to light the others

Friday my sister Jean arrives  
with Aric  
(it must be fifty years that they've been married!)  
making the long drive down from Brooklyn  
to join us for the last three days  
of candle-lighting  
to celebrate our mother's birthday  
she'd have been one hundred seven  
and to meet for the first time  
our daughter Loren's one-year-old  
Sylvie Marie
