Only a week ago and only  
one day out from what had been  
our West Virginia home  
for the past year  
I took an exit off the highway south  
from Iowa City  
and stopped beside the Mississppi  
at La Grange  
a bleak landscape  
no barge in sight  
the frozen surface  
dotted with snowdrifts  
on the far side  
and for miles downriver  
the banks lined with dark trees  
the sign I'd passed  
a few miles back said  
Welcome to Missouri  
and I wondered what it would be like  
to live in such a place  
perhaps the summers here  
are a delight but now in January  
I was happy to be on the road  
just passing by
