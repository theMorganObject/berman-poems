Cornstubble fields  
golden in the light of dawn  
stretching on to the horizon  
dotted here and there  
with clumps of angus cattle  
black, their heads bent down  
grazing in the late December cold

I drive past the long dragons of the sprinklers  
that guard the frozen fields  
where every mile or two or ten  
a grain silo  
looking for all the world  
like the Tin Woodsman's hat  
without the spout  
stands out silver and grey  
against the fields

Leafless trees along the highway sprout  
their traceries of branches  
intricate patterns dark against the sky  
a landscape sparse and yet not bleak  
but glowing in the morning light  
alive
