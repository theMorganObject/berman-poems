Driving north from Winnemucca as the dawn  
sets snowy hills alight  
pale fire descending  
slowly from the ridgeline  
to the valley floor  
the air so cold  
that even with the warmth  
inside my car  
I feel the the chill  
that grips the frozen fields

The wonder of it all  
the changing light that grows  
moment by moment  
here high above the towns  
that line the interstate  
it seems another world  
a world apart  
lifting the spirit with its sparse  
etherial beauty  
a vision to be treasured  
in days and years to come
