The wise poet's advice  
is don't let go  
hold fast the thread that runs  
through all the detours  
the blind alleys  
sudden sprints and pauses  
that compose your life

I think of Ariadne finding her way  
back through the labyrinth  
but who of us has hands that steady  
or that sure  
the trick is locating the place  
the moment when you lost it  
then working your way back  
and with luck  
finding the grace to pick it up again
