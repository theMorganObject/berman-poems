Good for her! I tell myself  
choosing the gypsy life  
leaving behind security  
wealth and the cage  
of a high-class marriage  
off with the wild caravan  
to ride bareback  
sleep out in the open  
a stirring ballad  
yet never  
or only for fleeting moments  
have I thought to wrest myself  
from this too sedentary  
and too comfortable life
