So still that all I hear is the humming  
of the fridge across the kitchen  
and the soft ringing in one ear  
which I've lived with for so long  
I scarcely notice it  
except in moments such as this  
when all else is silent

It ushers in - the stillness -  
what seems to me  
a pause in time  
as if the planet had stopped turning  
and the sun  
hidden behind the cloud cover  
had also paused  
giving the world a chance  
to catch its breath  
as I am trying  
to catch mine
