Walking up the hill  
through stands of scrub oak  
and madrone  
I pass a stranger heading down  
and say good morning  
and he says have you escaped?  
and I reply  
I'm working on it  
and he says don't worry  
I won't tell anyone  
I saw you  
and I stop a moment  
before offering him my thanks
