Bare sensuous limbs  
skin almost feminine  
color mimicking the orange berries  
you dropped off last fall  
you've come a distance  
migrating north as your homeland  
dried up  
became Sonoran desert  
back in the Miocene  
and though it's now been sixty years  
and more since I first settled  
in California and now  
west of the Oregon Cascades  
I still find you exotic  
so unlike your companion trees  
the oaks with their rough bark  
the pines and cedars  
you seem strange and yet I can't imagine  
these hills without you  
perhaps with time we recent immigrants  
will follow your example  
learn to settle as you've done  
give up our restlessness  
and like earlier immigrants  
the first nation people  
put down roots  
become endemic to the places  
we've chosen to call home
