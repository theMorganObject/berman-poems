Across the road and down the steps that lead me  
to the narrow path along the creek that trickles  
through a thicket of young cedars and madrones  
a lone redwood its bark the color of old bricks  
and hairy but still smooth compared  
with the grey wrinkled bark  
of neighbor trees  
stands there before me  
straight and tall  
I'm guessing eighty feet  
though still a baby  
if all goes well  
a thousand years from now  
it will be standing there  
dwarfing its companions  
but that's a long time  
no way for me to know its future  
what I know is it reminds me  
how I miss the coast  
the Humboldt County parks  
the ancient trees that might have been  
the size of this one  
while Moses was alive  
after the logging they say only five  
out of a hundred of the old ones are still here  
hard to imagine cutting such an ancestor  
walking among them I have felt my own  
true size - something akin to menehune  
or a leprachaun  
if like the Yurok or their neighbors  
we white folks had seen these trees  
not as a way to monied wealth  
but for the treasure they are in themselves  
what a different world we'd have to pass on  
to our grandchildren
