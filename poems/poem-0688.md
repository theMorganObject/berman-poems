After I'd pulled it down out of the tree  
where it was hanging  
just a loose vine or liana  
it turned into a snake and quickly grew  
to twenty feet or more  
and big around as the fat inner tubes  
we kids used to float on

Paying us no mind it headed off  
gliding through the grass  
as only a snake can glide  
until it reached the river far below

Then it swam  
its massive body undulating  
rythmically while we watched from above  
my wife and I

It moved with such effortless power and grace  
its head held regally  
a foot or more above the water's surface  
the sight so unexpected, so compelling  
we found ourselves enchanted  
and drawn together in our shared delight
