Handguns have just one use  
and as you know  
it's not for hunting pheasant  
shooting deer  
you've heard the saying  
"even a six-year old could dot dot dot"  
and that's what's in the news today  
a boy of six  
who shot his first grade teacher in the chest  
amazingly she lived  
where were the parents?  
and in what crazy country  
could a child so young  
have access to a handgun?
