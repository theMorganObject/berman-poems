I've read of tribal languages whose numbers  
reach to four and after four comes "many'.  
Today watching the geese  
down by the river  
I saw pairs  
(I'm told they mate for life)  
and groups of three or four  
and after that the many  
that we call a flock.  
I maybe could have counted  
if they'd just kept still  
but even then I'd have lost count  
which makes me think  
that four or maybe five  
is all the numbers  
we really need.

After that, you see, it gets political  
counting bodies, goods  
conscripting soldiers  
levying fines, collecting taxes  
and besides, four or five kids  
should be enough for anyone  
although my second wife was one of seven  
I wonder - did her mom ever lose count?  
mine would have been content  
to stop at two  
but dad had other thoughts  
and so my younger brother  
number four  
was "a mistake"  
of course a happy one

Perhaps I'm biased since after the first  
three marriages  
the fourth is such a happy one  
I'm ready now  
to welcome a world where numbers  
one through four  
are all that's needed  
four strings for cellos, violins, violas  
(who needs guitars?)  
and of course ukeleles  
which no-one plays  
without eliciting a smile or two  
or three or four  
Mahalo!
