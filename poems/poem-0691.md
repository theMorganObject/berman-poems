Tonight I feel the presence  
of the nearby hills  
that rise on all sides  
cupping our little town  
setting the river on its course  
across the valley floor and underneath  
the sixth street bridge  
halfway along its journey  
from the Cascades up near Crater Lake  
to the ocean at Gold Beach

Eyes closed I see the whitewater  
at Rainey Falls where come September  
sleek chinook leap up the eight foot drop  
seeking the smaller creeks  
the gravel beds  
places to make a redd  
to spawn and dying see their bodies  
washed away downstream

On summer days I've let the current  
carry me gaily splashing  
alongside our dogs  
who since last month  
live on only in vivid memory  
my wife's and mine  
so that those times we played  
there in the river  
with our canine kids  
seem doubly precious  
being unrepeatable

In childhood I scarcely knew rivers  
summers at the ocean were  
what saved me  
got me through all those cold  
winters outside Boston

Moving west my first love  
was the California coast  
from Big Sur down to Morro Bay  
and up from Stinson Beach to Mendocino  
the Lost Coast and all the Humboldt  
County coves and headlands  
tidepools, blowholes and lagoons

But since moving inland  
I've come to love the sights t  
he smells the sounds  
of Oregon's sweet rivers  
and especially the feeling of the Rogue  
cooling my body down  
on a hot summer afternoon
