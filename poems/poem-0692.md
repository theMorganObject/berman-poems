Are they real?  
of course they are!  
as real as anything we might encounter  
on the worldwide web  
or in our dreams  
which is in fact where I had  
my first run-in  
though only with the ships  
the aliens it seemed  
preferred to stay on board  
and out of sight

The ships themselves were huge  
which they would need to be  
to cross such distances  
even at warp speed  
yet it was less their size and number  
(there must have been twenty or thirty of them)  
than their sheer beauty that impressed me  
caused me to stop in my tracks  
gazing up into the blackness  
at the great wheels of light  
as they turned slowly, majestically  
high overhead

That was the moment I first knew  
even in my dreaming state  
that nothing would ever be the same  
that worlds were colliding  
and the intelligence that could create  
such beauty and such power  
would have no difficulty overturning  
the world I'd been inhabiting  
the world I'd always known  
it might take time  
but time was clearly on their side
