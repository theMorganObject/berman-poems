Sitting beside me as we drive  
south down I-5  
heading home together  
for the first time in a year  
my wife remarks "I'm always at my best  
when horizontal"  
It's her way of telling me her back  
hurts from sitting so long upright  
in the car  
I understand but still I'm laughing  
to myself as quite other thoughts  
and memories  
float across the dancefloor  
of my mind
