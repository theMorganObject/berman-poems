If I'm fortunate enough to reach the gates  
of cyber heaven  
and find I've lost the password  
will there be a way - I wonder -  
to reset it?  
will there be tech help  
or will I be consigned  
to linger an eternity or two  
in cyber purgatory?

Which is, in any case, the place  
I find myself inhabiting  
ever more frequently  
as I shuffle through my eightieth year  
and the passwords  
saved (or not saved?)  
on my desktop  
keep piling up  
(to use a metaphor)

Ah the world-wide-web!  
yes I believe it may  
yet help us to avoid the worst  
that global warming threatens  
but I'll be useless  
bogged down in lost passwords
