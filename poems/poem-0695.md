Today only historians still cite the names  
of the face cards  
the queens and emperors  
the proud aristocrats  
gaudy flowers of the Heian court

But here's a name  
Ono no Komachi  
about whose life we know nothing  
or next to nothing  
yet whose lyrics  
crafted with such passion  
such finesse that through  
close on twelve centuries  
she's touched the hearts  
of countless readers  
held her place  
among the goddesses of love

And yet her poetry suggests a mind too keen  
too sensitive  
too swayed by love's caprices  
for a life without  
more than its share of heartache  
and always asking the same question  
how much of this is dream  
and how much real?  
perhaps that's what endears her  
to so many and so now  
to me as well
