My friend Jess Moon - old-timer  
former timber-beast  
after years of working in the woods  
left for the safety  
of the scaling yard  
retired in his late sixties after a logtruck  
hit the little shack  
where he was doing  
some paperwork  
knocked it right over  
he was lucky  
just a few bruised ribs  
and knowing Jessa  
 a whole lot of cussing

He lived to ninety-seven  
thanks I suspect  
to a strong claim on life  
at four months old  
his missionary parents  
thinking the Congo no safe place  
for their new son  
had booked him passage  
you guessed it  
on the Titanic

Not a survivor - no  
their ferry ran aground  
back on the Congo River  
and they missed the boat  
doubtless there was some cussing  
over that as well  
(which makes my point)
