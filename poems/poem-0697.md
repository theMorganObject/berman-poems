Babe's Bakery  
a refuge of the college crowd  
and oldsters such as us  
no longer tied to offices  
or work out in the world  
offers up coffee  
and bagels on a day  
when overnight the weather gods  
have taken it upon themselves to gift us  
with a wonderland of fluffy coverlets  
while we slept warm  
as bunnies in a hutch

And dreamed of spring  
the garden once again in bloom  
roses and peonies suffusing  
the backyard world with fragrance  
and the many colors  
that winter had erased

Just a dream  
but now outside the bakery  
the town is reemerging  
lawns and shrubbery  
regaining what was lost  
beneath the snow  
and Carroll comes to tell me  
that it's time to go
