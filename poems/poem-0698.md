With flicks of her grey tail  
a winter visitor is rummaging  
through our backyard  
where raspberries  
reduced to leafless canes  
stand in ten gallon pots

With movements alternating  
between smooth  
and jerky  
she steals along the ground  
leaps up to dig  
with little paws  
in every pot  
then stops a moment  
as if trying to remember where  
she buried last September's seeds

Not a breath of wind  
hers is the only movement  
for miles around it seems  
all else is quiet  
all else is waiting  
for the next snowfall  
and the still distant spring
