// EDITOR'S NOTE: is this poem 669, not 699?

Tireless traveler  
it's only a short while  
since you strode on ahead  
crossed the horizon  
moving as always  
toward the light  
no longer held back  
by a mere body  
you've headed for the sun  
as it sets westward  
off the coast of Maui  
and even as your body fades  
your shadow lengthens  
opaque at times but glimmering  
with subtle light  
it reaches us who are still landbound  
while your voice  
like fabled Orpheus  
carries across  
gathering beasts and humans  
in its spell
