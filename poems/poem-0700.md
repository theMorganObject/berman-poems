He's perched high up  
where he can keep a lookout  
over the whole backyard  
flashing his uniform  
of denim blue and grey  
while she is hiding  
deep in the foliage  
flitting from branch to branch  
it's March  
another rainy day  
and either he's the winner  
of this year's competition  
or else they've been a couple  
for what might seem forever  
to a jay (I'm told  
they mate for life)  
and once again are busy  
exchanging gifts  
of twigs and other  
nesting stuff  
a clear reminder  
of last year's success  
raising a brood  
and now are making ready  
to present the world  
with yet another crop  
of loud and bright-eyed jays
