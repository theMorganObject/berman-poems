One night in the care of nurses  
angel sisters  
checking my vitals  
in the wake of surgery  
and now I'm home  
and though the air is cold  
the sun is up  
and I've just emptied out five bags  
of soil into a planting box  
and watered in the first seedlings  
bedding plants - cilantro, thyme, oregano  
six baby carrots  
the pepper seeds will have to wait  
for warmer weather  
such a good feeling though  
my hands and fingers in the soil  
and new green life to nurture
