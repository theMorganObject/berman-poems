Such focus  
such a serious face our Sylvie  
at sixteen months  
with her own make-believe  
blood-pressure pump and band  
bright blue  
taking her mother's arm  
wrapping the band  
the way she's watched the nurses  
do for her

She's seen her share of doctors  
nurses, hospitals  
now with her parents' help she's starting  
to take charge  
it makes me wonder  
if medicine will be her path  
later in life  
this much-loved granddaughter  
but for now  
it's joy enough to watch the two of them  
daughter and mother  
playing doctor and patient  
though stepping out  
of their respective roles  
in time for a good laugh
