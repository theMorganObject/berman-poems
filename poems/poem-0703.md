My wife says we won't miss them  
the two palm trees  
that someone who came north  
from San Diego  
or maybe Florida  
saw fit to plant along our driveway  
and that always seemed  
so out of place  
here in these hills  
this valley where the Rogue  
flows west from the Cascades  
wending its way  
two hundred miles to meet the coast

And still I feel their loss  
and some remorse for having been the one  
to cut them down  
though I agreed it would improve  
the view and felt like a good husband  
doing my part  
taking out the little chainsaw  
oiling the chain  
bringing the trunks down  
right where I'd intended  
with loppers cutting the long fronds

Still I couldn't help but notice that the fans  
were radiant in the sunlight  
their living greens recalling distant islands  
and warmer worlds whose seas I also saw  
reflected in the bright blue seeds  
a thousand berries  
clustered on sulphur yellow branchlets  
while the trunks  
wrapped in a dense fabric of coir  
thick as the fur on a bear's back  
lay on the ground like victims  
felled in some sneak attack  
maybe it's just that chainsaws are too fast  
make it too easy  
and it's true the view across the way  
to native firs and cedars  
is now clear  
but for the moment I feel haunted  
by the ghosts  
of those two trees  
by what was there
