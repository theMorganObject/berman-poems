Yesterday I baked rye bread  
three loaves  
and while I dug my knuckles  
in the warm dough  
thought of how combining words for loaf  
and she who kneads it  
hlaefdige  
Old English gave us lady  
and from loaf and he who guards it  
hlafweard  
it gave us lord

And that was centuries before the Normans  
graced us with their French  
their pork and beef  
that somehow made it easier  
to feast on pig and cow

Now my three loaves  
sit on the counter  
dense and brown  
pungent with fennel seed  
molasses, orange zest  
and I am happy knowing  
I have been both lord and lady  
at least for a day
