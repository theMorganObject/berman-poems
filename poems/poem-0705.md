Jim Polachek my roommate  
and friend of college years would say  
quoting some sage  
doubtless and to my ears  
as green back then  
as two green ears of corn  
it seemed a bit of wisdom  
to be stored away  
though soon enough I came to see  
such a pronouncement  
as little more than hubris  
yet there's value  
in the patience necessary  
not to pluck the fruit too soon  
to tend our gardens  
by the changing seasons  
of our lives  
nurture our dreams  
to cultivate our thoughts  
so that we may move at last  
with all the grace  
the power and inner sweetness  
that seem to flow  
from one who has arrived  
at their maturity  
that ripeness  
which if not everything  
comes close enough
