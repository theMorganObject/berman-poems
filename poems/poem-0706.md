for Howard Lenhoff

Some years ago  
when I was still a rabbi  
and you were in your eighties  
and we as yet knew nothing  
of the cancer that would take you  
from us and from this life  
more than once you asked me for a bracha  
a blessing for the moment that you told me  
you found so precious  
the sweet moment  
when you climbed in bed at night  
beside your Sylvia  
your dearest wife

Now that I too am entering my eighties  
I feel what you were feeling  
the desire for a few words  
a bracha  
to give thanks for the delight  
of slipping into bed  
night after night  
beside the body I holds dearest  
the sweet moment  
before dropping into sleep

Baruch Attah Adonai  
blest be the One  
who watches over lovers  
husbands and wives  
as they lie dreaming  
in eachother's arms  
blest be the gift  
of love that lasts till death  
and then beyond
