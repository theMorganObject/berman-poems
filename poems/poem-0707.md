for Jack Schuman - collector of instruments extraordinaire

If there's an afterlife for old musicians  
such as you and I  
I know I'll find you  
when my time comes  
even before our eyes  
meet I will hear you in the distance  
playing away  
on your vielle 치 roue

Which is what we lesser mortals  
call the hurdy-gurdy  
but vielle 치 roue you found a sobriquet  
more to your taste  
the taste of an art scholar  
with an eye  
for what makes certain instruments  
attractive - for example  
a centuries-old cittern  
from England or a talking drum  
from Africa or the lute  
called biwa from Japan  
where you were stationed  
at the end of World War Two  
or in particular  
a vielle 치 roue from France  
beautifully crafted  
and your favorite  
but all of them deemed  
along with a hundred others  
worthy of a place in your collection

My own love of the gurdy reaches back  
to college days  
when I first heard the Cantigas  
hymns to the Virgen - a vast collection  
sponsored by Alfonso  
learned king of Castille and Leon  
and saw the images that grace  
his book of hymns to Heaven's queen  
colored miniatures  
where Christian, Jew and Muslim  
sit or stand two by two  
playing instruments  
finely fashioned for the court  
in one scene two men play  
the boxlike hurdy-gurdies  
called symphonia

Later when I'd realized that music  
was my proper path  
and the guitar my instrument  
I went on pilgrimage to Spain  
there on the Portico da Gloria  
of the twelth-century church in Santiago  
I saw two sculpted angels  
top and center playing  
the great hurdy-gurdy  
known as organistrum  
and met Emilio Cao who played  
the Spanish gurdy - the zamfona  
much alive  
in the folk music of Galicia  
and so I found a gurdy of my own  
and started learning how to turn  
the rosined wheel

We've worked up some French tunes  
you too, Jack, would have known  
some tunes another friend  
and gurdyist will lead us in  
while we accompany with fiddle  
mandolin and smallpipes  
that's the first Sunday in May  
when we are set to honor you  
in concert and the choir  
will sing works by Vivaldi  
and Dietrich Buxtehude  
and we folkies  
will be there to celebrate your spirit  
with the more raucous sounds  
of French dance tunes  
played on the vielle 치 roue
