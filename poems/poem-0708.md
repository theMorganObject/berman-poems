Yes Da-vi-de though doubtless I'm the only one  
who thinks his name  
in its Italian iteration  
I guess because we met in class  
and used to practice  
speaking la bella lingua  
but now more often he's just Dave  
and we've retreated  
to English and moved on  
to other topics - the cinema  
one of his passions and about which  
he knows far more than I  
and books - his tastes  
if more conventional than mine  
are more wide ranging

For a time he wrote about his life  
and shared with me some of that work  
and I sent him some poems  
but he likes rhyme  
and clearly I'm no rhymer  
so now it's just whatever comes to mind  
our families - his daughters  
my new granddaughter  
and travels - he has been abroad  
more recently - to Italy again  
and I've been on the road  
driving to West Virginia and back  
twice in one year  
with Ollie cat for company  
through the long miles

Being gone I missed our conversation  
and weekly walks  
and now we're both in town  
and though the winter  
has lingered into April  
days of rain and snow  
we're due to meet tomorrow  
by the Rogue  
where it runs through the park  
and afterwards to warm our feet  
back at the coffee shop  
and hopefully I'll manage  
to keep up my end  
of both the walking  
and the conversation
