after Buson

Beside the path  
 their colors muted by the falling snow  
 a row of daffodils

It fell so furiously  
 only to melt in moments  
 without a trace

Where are they hiding  
 the birds who thought  
 spring had arrived

After the morning walk  
 the coffee shop says come  
 inside and warm your toes

This morning's snow flurries  
 gone but the memory  
 keeps swirling in my mind
