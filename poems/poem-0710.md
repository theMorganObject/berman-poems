From the Everglades  
migrating northward toward the Carolinas  
and westward to where eventually they'll slither  
into Mississippi and across the Gulf States  
so far there's been nothing  
that can stop their progress  
these sleek predators from Asia  
beautiful but hugely destructive  
of the birds  
the smaller mammals  
the acquatic life

Perhaps a metaphor  
for what the state itself  
seems bent on furthering  
placing a stranglehold  
on every school and college classroom  
telling teachers what they are  
allowed to teach  
their students learn about  
endorsing censorship of books  
throwing a woman's right to choose  
under the bus  
keeping the state's minimum wage  
where it has stood for years  
and now no permit needed  
for a hidden gun

Hard not to see in this  
a kind of seemingly benign fascism  
a governor whose rhetoric  
while subtler than Trump's  
like Mussolini  
postures as a saviour  
out to do the people's will  
the will of patriotic folk  
Christians whose kids should feel  
only pride in America  
(forget the history of genocide  
and slavery)  
who don't need immigrants  
taking their jobs or otherwise  
spoiling the neighborhood

Will DeSantis be our next president?  
where will his populism take us?  
many waiting for the Rapture  
would be happy if he rose to that office  
and though we're still a long way  
from Xi's China, Modi's India  
(forget the crazy Russian)  
things can shift toward a more authoritarian  
state with a surprising speed  
and whatever folks may tell themselves  
behind it all there's fear  
of what the future holds  
the premonition that the world  
is starting to upend

Almost too big to talk about  
the elephant whose shadow fills the room  
is global warming  
with its litany of woes  
and while we've just begun  
to feel it's impact here in North America  
soon there will be no going back  
to the world we have known

And so the fear is real  
if still only dimly imagined  
and Florida's already had a taste  
of what is coming although  
when Greenland's glaciers finish melting  
much of Florida will be  
beneath the sea

In any case one can expect  
the hurricanes to be more powerful  
tides to rise still higher  
temperatures to soar  
and climate refugees to be  
more than can be carted off  
to Marthas Vineyard

All this a perfect recipe  
for demagogues and the false hopes  
offered by liars such as Trump and charismatic  
politicians like DeSantis

Meanwhile those of us who see the world  
through different lenses  
would prefer to follow Jesus as he's quoted  
in the book of wisdom  
the Gospel of Thomas:

If the Kingdom were in heaven  
the birds would get there first  
but it's before your eyes if  
you would only open them!

And so we pray for our beloved grandchildren  
that their lives be rich as ours  
their world as green and vibrant  
and their days as full of music  
love and wonder
