Just off the deck  
outside the kitchen window  
in pots where my wife set the bulbs  
a year ago  
or more - each stem topped with a star  
six-petalled  
like the star of David  
pale and glowing  
in dusk's deepening light  
as if to honor tonight's Passover  
and Sunday's Easter  
and something older  
than them both
