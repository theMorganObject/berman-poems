Because death rides my shoulder now  
a half-tamed hawk  
calling me to sharper vision  
greater depth  
I look for clues to how the path  
opened before me  
led me blind through the green forest  
of my childhood  
and at last into my life

Today it is a memory that feels  
as old as I am  
so distant I don't know the place  
or year it happened  
perhaps even before my father  
came back from the war  
what I do know is that the day  
was warm and sunny  
and we'd stopped beside a stream  
but who was with me  
and how we came there  
those things are long gone

What lives on is the joy I knew  
watching the water  
as it flowed beneath the footbridge  
sparkling in the sun  
the long-legged insects  
skimming the water's surface  
where their feet made tiny dimples  
all that was magic  
and comes back clear as in a dream  
from which I've just awoken  
and with it all the solitude the lonelines  
that was for years my closest friend  
and which at times  
still calls on me to comfort  
that boy  
who still delights in all the little lives  
that buzz about our yard and through our garden  
making me happy he's still here still hanging out with this old man
