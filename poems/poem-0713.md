It came as a surprise  
to both of us  
the relief we felt  
the moment we had chosen  
where our bodies  
or at least our ashes  
were to lie  
a choice agreed on  
as if by chance  
and then a phonecall  
and a check made over  
to the caretaker  
all smooth and effortless  
like floating downstream  
on a peaceful summer day

The spot was perfect  
under a broad oak  
up from the road a ways  
just thirty feet  
from my wife's parent's headstone  
and her sister's  
Robert and Gerry whom I knew  
only a short while  
and Linda  
whom I never knew thanks to the cancer  
that took her long before we'd met  
Carroll and I

That thirty feet seemed a respectful distance  
and with our chosen spot now set  
clearly in mind  
one more weight's been lifted from  
these aging shoulders
