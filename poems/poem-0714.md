When I'd just graduated and about to drive  
to California for further schooling and begin  
a life with Joan and we'd been married only a few months  
I had no way of knowing there would be  
aside from family visits once or twice a year  
no coming back from the West Coast but maybe I did have  
a premonition since before we left I chose to visit one last time  
the place that had been the true heart of my childhood world  
my greatest love the summer island mapped in mind  
and memory in more detail than any merely paper map  
could be and I don't remember now the time I spent there  
on that brief visit but I do remember what I felt  
returning on the ferry namely that this was my farewell  
to childhood that I would be a man at last  
and so a mix of sadness and of pride and that was all  
such nonsense since even if you can't go home again  
neither can you leave it behind simply by embracing  
a new life or by some other magic gesture and if you've been  
as fortunate as I was to have such a place of nurture whether island or farm or city neighborhood or a house where parents  
or grandparents made you feel forever welcome and deeply loved it will go on nurturing you even as you stumble as we all do through all life's unexpected turnings and bewilderments  
and that place will be there to comfort you and help you keep your balance and at the end it will still be there  
awaiting your return
