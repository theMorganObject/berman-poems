Even before the first green leaves appear  
cloaking the dark silver  
of the limbs  
the maple flowers dangle  
in bright clusters  
of coral red that glow  
when as today the sun  
mostly in hiding these past weeks  
decides to show itself  
the flowers seem  
diminutive for a such a tree  
but when they fall the ground is carpeted  
with a rich reddish brown  
which says the next act  
this year's spring leafing out  
is coming soon
