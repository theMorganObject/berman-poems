Memory memento reminiscence  
mental manic mantic mantra musings  
music - others come to mind  
mind being one  
all cousins whose deep ancestry  
linguists have excavated  
tracing the thread  
through Latin, Greek and Persian  
Sanskrit and further back  
like shards of pottery  
set in a mortar  
in honor of the muse  
and we honor the form  
by calling it  
after the muse - mosaic  
so the scattered children  
of this family reflect eachother  
suggest a pattern  
shards of meaning  
each one adding something to the whole  
giving range and depth to help us think  
again where meaning lies  
where mind  
look! there they are  
again the m and n sounds  
Sanskrit mantra  
Greek mania  
Latin mens sana  
a sound mind  
so we are led toward holiness  
or madness or sanity  
I'm all for sanity  
but still hold to the words  
of Paul Verlaine  
c'est la musique  
avant toute chose  
in poetry  
music before all else
