One fall I planted turnips and by January  
they'd come up gangbusters  
their white and purple tops  
breaking the surface but then  
we had an unexpected frost  
a hard one lasting days  
not common on the California coast  
and all the turnips froze  
like rocks and so I thought ok  
that's it they're goners but then  
once it warmed a bit  
they went on growing just as if  
nothing had happened and in this way  
I learned how come my Jewish ancestors  
back in Lithuania and Poland  
along with cabbage and potatoes  
were big on turnips
