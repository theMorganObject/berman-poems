Stretched out beside  
the little elderberry whose new leaves  
whisps of dark purple  
are just emerging from the nodes  
our orange coon cat  
weighing in at sixteen pounds  
is basking in the morning sun  
watch out you robins  
and jays his ears are perked to catch  
the faintest chirp or rustle  
I've seen him leap straight up  
three times his length  
to snatch a passing butterfly  
and with his tawny coat he is  
the garden's perfect ornament
