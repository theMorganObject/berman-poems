In my dream it was the four of us again  
hiking along a trail  
that led through woods which though  
not dense for being close to home  
seemed strangely unfamiliar  
at one point there were children  
and a fox  
but it was tame and the two dogs  
paid little notice  
then suddenly the path descended  
to a stream we had to wade  
and which we found was deeper  
than expected  
Carroll crossed first and started climbing  
the cliffs that rose up steeply  
on the other side  
I tried to follow but my feet  
couldn't take hold  
in the loose sand  
and so I looked downstream to where  
the cliffs left off  
and things began to level out  
my fear was for the dogs  
how would they manage this crossing  
Hassan seemed older  
less vigorous than I'd remembered  
and from puppyhood Lucca had never  
taken to water  
at the river  
we'd always had to throw him in
