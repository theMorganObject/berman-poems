Now as April stumbles into May  
on every streetcorner the cherry trees  
stand out like saints  
preaching repentence  
urging us to leave behind  
our too restrained and penny-pinching ways  
with every limb they voice the gospel  
of exhuberance  
don't hide your colors people  
shout them out  
as we do say the cherries  
let the sap of spring rise up  
burst out in beauty  
in song and loving words  
let the world  
find healing in the colors hidden  
in your heart  
let them shine out  
abundant as the blossoms  
that bejewel our every bough
