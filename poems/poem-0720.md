for John McPhee

With Annals of the Former World you gifted us  
the planet's slow unfolding - past eons  
made visible in roadcuts  
in the weathering of mountain ranges  
you gave us words to catch at least a glimpse  
of how the scientists you travelled with  
crossing the continent  
and not just once  
go about their work of gathering  
sifting through pieces of the puzzle  
seeking to place them in a story  
as coherent as the one you tell  
and though we have names  
such as Cambrian Ordovician Silurian  
Devonian more than I can remember  
my mind was never fitted out to grasp  
the depths of time  
three point five billion years since the first trace  
of life appears  
but I take comfort like Boethius  
who in his prison cell  
wrote of the consolation of philosophy  
there's something in the story  
of geologic time  
that consoles me as I meditate  
on the planet's unimaginably slow  
transition from one era to the next  
and how in fifty million years  
when all we know has vanished  
and we too are gone  
or perhaps by some miracle of evolution  
have evolved into a wiser and less violent  
version of ourselves  
the earth will still revolve around the sun  
new mountains will be rising and new rivers  
finding their way to seas other than those  
we know and this small blip of time  
which is our world  
will live on only in the annals of eternity
