All these years later  
you would think we'd grasped  
his message of nonviolence  
of tolerance and selfless love  
but no - our pagan hearts  
still cling to visions of a warrior  
whose army will  
any day now  
overturn this fallen world  
leaving all unbelievers desolate  
while he transports his faithful  
ones to bliss and promised  
realms of glory
