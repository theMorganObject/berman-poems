Two weeks three days of counting  
from the second day  
of Pesach and we are in the realm  
of Tiferet the sefirah of radiance  
the place where fortitude  
and lovinkindness meet  
within the human heart  
the heart of Jacob  
on the night he wrestled  
with the angel who at daybreak  
fled leaving his opponent  
with a new name  
and a limp  
and a heart made whole

Over the years we too have wrestled  
my sweet wife and I  
her love has been my healing  
and though my love for her  
at times stumbles along  
unlike Jacob I wake to find  
the angel still in my arms  
and the old limp mostly gone
