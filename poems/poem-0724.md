It was after we had moved to the new house

on Homer Street so I must have been

eight or maybe nine the day my parents brought us kids to see the circus and I remember only vaguely the big tent the crowd the tightrope artists and the elephants or maybe just one elephant I can't be sure but what was more exciting than all that was coming home with a chameleon in a little carboard box with a string tied around its neck to keep it from scampering off and what was wonderful was how it changed from blue and pink to green and brown first the sky with sunset clouds then the colors of the woods and I had no idea how to feed it so I took it out into the garden

and let it go
