It was I think the summer I turned twelve and  
 sleeping as usual on a mattress on the floor of the garage beside the heavy sliding doors with their long rows of glass panes along the doortops each pane maybe  
seven by ten inches it was mid august with the usual  
 summer heat and I was sound asleep when woken  
after midnight by what I thought must be the Germans flying over strafing and the sound was deafening and shards of glass were spraying where I slept as every pane  
 was being shattered it was too dark to see much but I managed to get up and stumble halfway into the yard then back again beneath the shelter of the eaves since hailstones the size of golfballs were pelting down though by morning they had melted and listening to the grownups talking I learned that every greenhouse on the island had been wrecked and car roofs dented and all the beach umbrellas that had been left out were full of holes and what I felt was happy that it hadn't been the Germans after all
