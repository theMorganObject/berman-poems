There's your daddy my mother said

pointing to the man in uniform who'd

just come off the boat and so I ran not towards him but in the opposite direction and that was

the start of a lifelong ambivalence which may be typical of sons and their fathers especially when the fathers are high-powered and the sons more sensitive and less ambitious but in this case my distrust went deeper because where had he been the first nearly three years of my life when a father might have come in handy and why was I suddenly less the focus of my mother's attention and of course there was no way I could compete

with the patriarchy
