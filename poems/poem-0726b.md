Wide the valley stretching out from Eileen's horse farm to the horizon where white against the sky Mount Lassen rises still snow-covered on a day when April is saying a last goodbye

Against the valley's hundred shades of green  
the distant mountain seems unearthly white  
as if a glacier of fantastic size had been placed there for us to wonder at  
while heedless of distant mountains the horses calmly graze on new spring grass
