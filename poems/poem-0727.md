is singing to herself her voice unsteady tremulous but clear and just to hear it brings a smile since she's been shy about it all these years just as she's been shy about her body though we've been bed partners coming up on two decades her shyness touches something in me that I can't quite fathom but time and again brings on a surge of tenderness reminding me how grateful I am for this great love that has made these years the sweetest of my life
