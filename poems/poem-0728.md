The spring came late this year and only now has it leafed out the elderberry that my wife transplanted from our country place to beautify our garden here in town and though they call it black for the black berries that by next fall will ripen in their clusters the boughs are grey the leaves dark purple the leaf stems lime green and just

this year it's shot up fifteen feet and though not suitable for making flutes or elderberry wine it's a joy to watch as it springs back from bare boughs to this leafy exhuberance
