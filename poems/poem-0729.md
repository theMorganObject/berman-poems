After the operation took away my singing voice  
a host of songs I hadn't sung in half a lifetime  
came back to me  
happily singing on their own  
like flowers blooming unexpectedly  
in a long abandoned garden  
old hymns and folksongs that I'd learned  
in childhood at the gatherings  
my grandparents would host on Sunday evenings  
throughout the summer months  
and now the songs come round  
and I've little choice  
but to hush up and listen
