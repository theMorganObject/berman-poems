There's a pond along the road to Edgartown  
and a bike path I pedalled summer  
after summer so that even now  
three thousand miles away  
my mind has conjured up not just the pond  
with its unpainted dragon some folk artist  
pieced together out of driftwood  
for the sheer whimsy of it  
but along the road another mile  
down on the ocean side  
the cove with its one-masted sailboat  
tethered to the dock and sunlight glancing  
off the water out past Chappaquiddick  
and Nantucket Sound
