It was my college roommate who remarked  
quoting I don't know whom  
ripeness is everything  
and now that I'm myself if anything  
 a bit overripe I can look back  
and see that if he wasn't entirely right  
neither was he wrong  
and on these afternoons in late july  
with the mercury rising into the nineties  
I find the watermelon much like life  
sweetest at the center
