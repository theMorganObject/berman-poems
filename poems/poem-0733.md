that's what my wife calls him  
now that he's shrunk to a mere vestige  
of his former self  
thanks to the cancer drugs absconding  
with my testosterone  
leaving me bereft in that department  
where the little rascal once held forth  
as dean of gynocology  
ah well  
sex always was mostly an act  
of memory and imagination  
and having moved on past my eightieth year  
the memories return  
as sweet as ever
