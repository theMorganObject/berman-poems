In a time before the hours began  
to link up like a train of railroad cars  
behind a locamotive  
already it was sounds that drew me  
more deeply than the world my eyes could conjur

Winters there was the thunderous rattling  
of coal down the coal chute  
into the coal bin under the basement window  
and the the stream of piss that spattered  
loudly against the pavement while the drafthorse waited  
for the iceman with his tongs to set a block  
of ice on our back porch

in June there was the sudden blast  
of the Islander's deep-throated foghorn  
warning the lesser boats  
as she cleared the harbor mouth  
chugging out into the waters of Nantucket sound

And then the voices joined above the hymnals  
on Sunday evenings  
at my grandpa and grandma's summer home  
on Lagoon Pond

It was all music to my ears  
the wind that whispered  
through the oaks  
the car tires hissing  
on the road after a rain  
my father's voice reading to us at night

So even before I'd found my singing voice  
and my path had shown itself to me  
already it was the cries  
the noise the sounds  
the music of the living world  
that breached my armor  
reached me where I lived
