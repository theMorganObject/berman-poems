Was it the eels  
(he had dissected some four hundred  
looking for what wasn't there i.e.  
the missing penis)  
that shifted his perception of the girls  
the stylish beauties of Trieste  
he wrote his friend about  
soon after his arrival  
bellas bestias he called them  
lovely creatures  
(or pretty animals) and by the end  
of his brief stay declared them brutas brutas  
ugly ugly every one  
well he was just nineteen  
and a provincial to boot  
years later  
having gone on to dissect instead of eels  
our hidden lives  
he conjured women's envy of the very thing  
he'd failed to find there in Trieste  
it gives one pause
