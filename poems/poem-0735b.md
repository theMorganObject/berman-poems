after Buson

Beside the path  
 their colors muted by the falling snow  
 a row of daffodils

It fell so furiously  
 only to melt in moments  
 leaving no trace

Where are they hiding  
 the little birds who thought  
 spring had arrived

After the morning walk  
 the coffee shop says come on  
 in and warm your toes

This morning's flurries  
 still swirling in my mind  
 a storm of snowflowers
