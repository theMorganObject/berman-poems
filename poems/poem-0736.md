Who was the woman of my dream  
wanting to make a child with me?  
we two in bed  
both with our clothes on  
no sex no love but a great feeling  
of respect and sympathy

Her house was set in barren hills  
a silver lake but without trees  
I asked her how she felt about  
being so distant from the sea

And how she wished to go about this  
I could manage either way  
make love or bring her what she needed  
she said she'd talk it over  
with her husband when he returned  
later that day

So I left ready to drive off  
but in the car I realized  
I'd left behind wallet and keys  
and only then did I remember  
I'd had my tubes tied years before  
how could I not have thought of this  
when she first asked  
if I would do this thing for her

Went back up the stairs to tell her  
found her in tears and had no heart  
to blurt out the truth  
just took my wallet  
and my keys and drove away
