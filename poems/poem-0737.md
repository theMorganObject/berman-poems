Socialism I could get on board with  
thinking of Sweden perhaps  
or Canada though every system  
has its flaws and every country  
its contradictions and injustices  
God knows the US is no paradise  
for workers or really for anyone  
but with Comrade Xi its the particular  
Chinese Characteristiics that scare me  
and I'm happy not to live in that man's camp  
which seems to verge (ironically) on Lu Xun's vision  
of a great room packed tight with men and women  
his fellow citizens  
and the walls slowly closing in
