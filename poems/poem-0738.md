Long ago when I was old and lying  
on my deathbed I looked up  
and saw a shadow slip in through the door  
I'd left half open and approach me  
in the semi-dark  
offering his hand but I said no  
I'll do this on my own  
still it was he who led the way  
until we reached the place  
the jumping off place  
no fear then - knowing  
there would be no landing to that leap  
and so I lept and fell and fell until the falling  
turned finally to flight and then to soaring  
the joy a hawk might feel who's caught an updraft  
and circles ever higher while still seeing  
everything that lies below

Now that I'm so much younger  
though my body has other thoughts  
ideas of its own  
my heart for instance  
may be in need of a vacation  
if not this year  
then likely next year or the next  
and if I'm fortunate enough that once again  
the guide of souls proffers his hand  
this time I'll grasp it  
in my own and and gratefully
