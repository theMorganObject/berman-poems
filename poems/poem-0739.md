Twelve years ago tonight she was still breathing  
if only fitfully  
and by the morning she'd moved on  
happy I lthink  
to be rejoining her companion  
her one great love - her Hal

She'd worried that the four years  
he'd been living on his own  
there on the other side  
might have distanced him  
or that God forbid he'd started  
up with someone new  
but I'm as certain  
as one can be about such things  
that their long marriage  
has only entered a new  
even more intimate and tender phase
