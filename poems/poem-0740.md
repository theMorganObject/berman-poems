reach out to you not knowing  
who you are  
or where you find yourself  
in time and space  
or in your life  
perhaps an oldtimer like me  
days mostly in the past  
who now contents himself  
with conjuring lost loves, lost chances  
the lost certainties of youth  
and also savoring the precious hoard  
of memories the riches  
stored in heaven

Or perhaps you're only starting  
on the path that with a bit of luck  
some guidance and your own tenacity  
will lead at last to your full share  
of what life offers  
truer loves and deeper joys  
and wider vistas while you hold  
fast to that precious gift  
to gaze upon the world  
with childlike wonder

Even as I fill this page with words  
I'm wishing you patience  
to wait and trust that life  
will bring you back in some new form  
the things you thought you'd lost  
or left behind and that you've grieved  
even unknowingly  
since life itself seeks wholeness  
and if given time  
will find a way to make us whole  
to bring things 'round again
