With its stovepipe reaching head height  
and then turning  
ninety degrees to exit through the wall  
the little gas stove in the corner  
looks for all the worlld  
to be a woodstove with its glowing coals  
its log and grate  
but these are fake only the flame  
that dances back behind the grate is real  
as is also the warmth that softly  
reaches out into the room

Both the warmth and dancing flame  
I find a comfort  
on this chill October night  
while out the window  
the night sky has filled with moonlight  
as if to usher in  
the first freeze of the fall
