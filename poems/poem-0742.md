My hip too sore to move about  
I'm happy sitting  
sipping the coffee my sweet Carroll brought  
and marvelling at how the filtered sunlight  
plays with the late October leaves  
although so-far the overarching oaks  
have kept their canopy of green  
catching the last photosynthetic light  
while their dark branches  
twist around all serpentine  
and over there the stately dogwood  
has only now begun acknowledging  
the nightly freeze but here close by  
a maple tree that's branched out gracefully  
not a native - she must be Japanese  
leaf-fronds glowing with a fifty shades of yellow  
red and orange - all a-dazzle  
as Hopkins so well put it  
and now I too  
offer my praise to the creator  
of such beauty as this day  
this hour has brought
