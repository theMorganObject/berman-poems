More rubble piling up before her feet  
Ukraine, Israel, Somalia, Sudan  
the list goes on  
in Africa alone some 40 million  
are said to be "displaced"  
and while it's not her fault  
she has I think at least some responsibility  
since Madonna-like she keeps silent  
for the most part while once again the past  
serves as an excuse for attrocity  
for war and all the rhetoric  
that wars demand or else provide  
the invocation of past injuries  
or else of glorious epochs  
past empires calling out to be restored  
take Putin dreaming of the former Soviet Union  
or Hamas imagining a Califate  
that stretches from the Nile to the Euphrates  
while Israel's religious right thinks of Judea  
before Rome and the diaspora  
and longs to see the Temple finally restored  
ready to welcome the Messiah  
and in another corner of the planet  
Comrade Xi imagines what was once  
the Chinese empire - Hong Kong, Tibet, Taiwan  
and the South China sea  
while here in the US many among us  
look toward a strongman who will make  
our country "Great Again"  
I can't help but think of Mussolini  
who also dreamed a Greater Italy  
and ask myself when ever  
will we awaken from this dream
