who'd have guessed  
those tiny shrewlike mammals  
would give rise to smilodons and wolly mammaths  
dolphins a dugongs  
and such clever apes as us?  
So I wonder when this current extinction  
has run its course  
who will be next?  
It will take some time of course  
ten million years on average  
but it's a given something new will thrive  
perhaps this time around the planet  
will host a cast of players just as colorfull  
but with less need to prey on one another  
and in some form beyond imagining  
the best in us will surface once again
