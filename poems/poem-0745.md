These Winter's Tales  
words falling on the page like snowflakes  
each one unique and beatiful  
conjuring worlds and lives  
from quite another time  
and place and yet  
no different from our own  
when it comes to the vicissitudes  
of fate the lostness of our hearts the dreams  
unrealized and all that might have been had we  
but known the time to speak  
and what it was that needed saying
