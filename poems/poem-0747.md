the ones that Einstein said He didn't play with  
but I ask myself how even Einstein  
or any of us could be so sure  
did the Allmighty keep them tucked  
away in his back pocket?  
all I know is if my mother and her cousin Kingsley hadn't become so close  
after his mother died  
the year that he tuned nine  
and if he hadn't gone to Dartmouth  
and met a classmate who thanks to Kingsley  
acting as go-between  
became my father you dear reader wouldn't be wasting precious time reading these words
