and still learning the basics  
nothing for granted take nothing  
for granted not the platoon  
of ants scouting along the windowsill  
or the last maple leaves clinging  
to the branch outside our window  
just as I cling  
to whatever feeds my soul  
delights my eyes  
my ears  
the way your whispers  
reach me in the night  
as we lie curled against eachother  
chaste in body  
if not in imagination  
your body  
the one thing I could never  
take for granted
