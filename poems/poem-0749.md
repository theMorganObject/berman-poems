The seventh night - eight candles  
counting the central one  
the shamash  
which our grandaughter  
knows to light first and then raise  
to light the seven others  
moving from right to left  
like writing Hebrew

With the electricity turned off  
the flames illuminate the room  
with their soft glow  
a truer counterpart  
to that soft inner light  
we call the soul

And now our Kyla's face has all the radiance  
of a madonna by Rublov  
or Botticelli but less pale  
no icon but the living flesh  
come down through all the ancestors  
to grace this house  
this moment touched by the eternal light
