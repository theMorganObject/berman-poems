We were on a mission though the goal  
was far from clear and somewhere  
along the way I lost track of my wife Carroll  
she'd gone into a store I think it was  
a women's clothing store and I waited outside  
for a long time or what seemed a long time and when the store was closing and all the lights inside went out I thought maybe she'd left  
and I'd missed her so I went on my way  
now with another younger woman  
one I didn't know but still felt comfortable with  
her face and accent suggested  
a Latin background anyway next thing I knew  
I was walking with a tall young man  
a stranger but somehow also my companion  
and we were moving fast through narrow streets  
within the Harvard campus but no open spaces  
just buildings on either side and though our destination was the statue of John Harvard where I hoped once again to meet with Carroll  
we took a turn through a door to the right and into what turned out to be a vast museum with oversized statues that appeared to be  
of medieval origin something about them reminded me of Jung and as we stood  
in the museum store my young companion chose a ceramic plate that was a mother whale and her whale baby and I remarked how touching they seemed together and approved his purchase and I thought I might try calling Carroll with my cellphone did I have it with me I'm not sure becauseat that point I woke up and felt again the pain in my left hip the piriformis muscle pressing  
on the nerve that's nearly immobilized me  
these last two months and I thought at least  
I was up and walking freely in my dream
