"even the electron is uncertain of its properties"  
 Paul Davies - The Goldilocks Enigma

Thank you Mr Heisenberg for pointing out  
nearly a century ago what hitherto  
lay hidden at the heart of things  
the principle by which a particle  
say an electron may know precisely where  
it finds itself or else how fast it's travelling  
but never both at once which well describes  
my own uncertainty regarding where I am  
in life or else in moments when my current place  
seems clear then to be wholly in the dark  
as to the path ahead or the momentum  
that's thrusts me forward down the swooping arc  
that is my life's trajectory so I'm relieved to know  
it's not some failure some defect of character but something built into the very fabric  
of spacetime and I am no more muddled  
than the particles that form my atoms
