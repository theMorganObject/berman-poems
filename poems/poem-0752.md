Less elemental than the artichoke  
or pair of socks whose qualities Neruda  
singled out for celebration  
in his famous odes  
nevertheless I offer up my praise for this  
gastronomic delight this flaky bit of pastry  
whose name bespeaks the debt we owe  
the french bakers - a debt of gratitude  
since paired up with caf√© au lait it makes  
a lovely start to any morning and so to this  
first morning of the year
