It was in church of all places  
hearing the priest recite his weekly sermon  
that I got the news:  
even the stars are born  
live out their lives and die  
and so the hymn we'd sung  
on sunday evenings throughout the summer  
sitting in grandfather's living room  
verses that spoke of stars eternal as God's love  
was just a story  
not that I thought of that then but I did feel  
a sense of loss as if nothing were as permanent as I'd been led to believe  
and if even the stars die how could God's love  
last forever
