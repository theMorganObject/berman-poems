Turmeric and tamarind, cumin and coriander  
curry leaves and cardamom (both green and black)  
and fenugreek  
saffron threads and star anise, tellicherry peppercorns  
names that linger in the ear  
pungent and as colorful  
as the spices they evoke

With that I'm ready to pack up my sea chest  
travel down the old spice route  
follow the ancient Arab traders  
from Cairo across the Arabian Sea to Malabar  
docking at Cochin and Allepey  
where coconut palms line the shore  
where still the markets teem with fresh-caught fish  
and shellfish and a world of fragrant spices

There I'll enjoy the toddy shops  
learn to cook coconut curry shrimp  
shallots with tamarind, fried plantain fritters  
ah if I were just a decade or three younger  
not plagued with sciatica  
had still the strength I used to take  
so easily for granted

But even here in grey and wintery Oregon  
a man can cook up a new dish  
try a new spice or two  
and what's an old man's life without  
a fantasy of foreign climes  
of summer skies and the allure of  
palm trees bending in the offshore breeze  
the murmuring of exotic tongues  
another world waiitng to be explored
