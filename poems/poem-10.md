End of august  
hot dry month  
fires burning to the south  
pond bone dry  
but the creek  
still holds a trickle  
yesterday  
great blue heron  
came to call  
voice so unbirdlike  
raw and raucous  
took me back to  
the Jurassic  
living dinosaur  
but how graceful  
her landing in the tree  
behind the pond  
one brief moment  
an image etched  
in memory
