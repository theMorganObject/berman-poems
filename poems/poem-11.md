    			for song is a burning and crested act
    				fire of birds in the worlds turning wood
    									D.T.

Powerful words that gave me  
courage to turn away  
from what had seemed so safe  
the mothering academy  
safe perhaps but in my dream  
my left hand had withered  
and the surgeon all too eager  
ready to amputate  
no, I said my hand will heal  
and so it did  
once I had made the leap  
begun to live out of  
my real love my gift  
a gift of song of music  
that has led me through the world  
so lightly smoothly that I cannot help  
but be amazed  
and if only rarely burning  
or crested - god knows I'm no Dylan  
yet I share his joy his wonder  
at this God-speeded summer's end
