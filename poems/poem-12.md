Tonight I'm thinking back on how  
we two rode our bicycles  
up island from Oak Bluffs to Lobsterville  
and somewhere near Squibnocket  
( I love the island's Wampanoag names  
Katama, Chappaquiddick, Tashmoo)  
parked the bikes beside a tidapond  
and waded in  
what we saw looking  
through kneedeep water  
delighted and amazed us  
all the sandy bottom  
glittering and alive  
there must have been at least a thousand  
horseshoe crabs each one  
no larger than a silver dollar  
each with a translucent shell  
like lightly frosted glass and showing  
all their inner workings  
holding one in my palm  
a tickling sensation  
the scuffling of tiny limbs  
I doubt that many of us  
think of horseshoe crabs as beautiful  
but these babies were beautiful  
and this was something I'd not seen  
in over sixty summers  
on the island

Today in Grants Pass, Oregon  
out in the shimmering  
swelter of summer's end  
with wildfires burning to the south  
I thought of how  
as our planet heats up  
we may be forced to build our cities  
under water  
it's the stuff of science fiction  
but with that image surfacing  
I thought about the horseshoe crabs  
not crabs at all  
closer to spiders  
they've been around  
we're told four hundred  
million years  
I've little doubt they'll make it through  
and though I can't say why  
somehow I find that knowledge comforting  
And if the oldsters have only the beauty  
of an armored tank  
the young forever will be jewels of the sea
