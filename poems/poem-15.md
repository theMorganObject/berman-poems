A whole day spent sanding  
the old garage doors  
whose faded panels cried out  
for resuscitation  
namely for a fresh coat  
of redwood deck stain  
hardly heroic labor  
but my sweet wife saw fit  
to photograph me  
brush in hand  
texted me to say  
how she adores her competent  
man of the house  
and that was all the praise  
needed to redeem  
those tedious hours of sanding  
leaving me at peace  
and grateful as I lie here  
now beside her listening  
to the sound of her snoring  
softly in her sleep
