for John Erickson

A small church  
just a few blocks from Red Square  
no pews  
the faithful standing  
shoulder to shoulder  
on this eve of Easter Sunday  
the gold icon wall  
shone in the lamplight  
as the priest chanted the service  
starting low  
and rising step by step  
till he could go no higher  
then at midnight  
with the lights turned off  
we stood immersed  
in total darkness  
each holding a candle  
we'd been given  
the priest lit first one flame  
then there were two  
then four, then eight, sixteen  
as the light passed  
from each to her neighbor  
until the whole church  
was lit up with the soft glow  
of a hundred candles

Then suddenly the church  
began to shake  
an earthquake?  
no, the army  
missiles thundering  
along the narrow street  
ICBMs  
engines of armageddon  
this the moment chosen  
to rehearse  
for May Day's  
show of military pride

What I witnessed then  
has stayed with me  
I saw that not a soul  
inside the church  
had payed the least attention  
to the shaking ground  
the thunder of the trucks  
their fearful cargo  
all that was unreal  
and what was real  
was how through the dark space  
candle to candle  
the little light was passed  
until it grew  
bringing light  
to the whole church  
a mystery  
meant for the soul  
for its illumination

I felt within a kindling of gnosis  
of a wisdom running deep  
deeper than faith  
and though a youngster  
I saw then  
that we are here  
both first and last  
to pass as best we can  
that precious light  
from one soul to another  
light of our faith  
light of our hope  
light of God's love
