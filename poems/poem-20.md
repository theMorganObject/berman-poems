Angel wings and venus combs  
murex, cowries, helmet shells  
chambered and paper nautilus  
all those exotic beauties spoke  
to the eager boy I was  
sang as shells do  
held to the ear  
of island archipelagos  
beaches scoured by the waves  
of distant oceans  
places I would likely  
never see

Later it was the romance  
of creating a collection  
seeing if I could find and name  
all the native Vineyard shells  
knobbed whelk, channel whelk  
moon shell, quahog, razor clam  
mussel, periwinkle, limpet  
I think it was the names as much  
as the shells themselves  
that drew me in

The collection lived on a while  
in my parents' Atlanta garage  
along with other childhood remnants  
but that was a long time back  
now when I think of those lovely forms  
I'm reminded of how the seas are changing  
the acid that's making it ever harder  
for molluscs to make their shells

Will the shells I loved as a child  
come to be something mostly viewed  
behind glass in museum cases  
relics of an age before  
ocean acidification?

It's a thought that saddens me  
remembering my island childhood  
in a time already changed  
not for the better but not yet  
beyond all recognition

Don't know what the future  
might hold for my great-grandchildren  
but for my son's three youngsters  
grown up beside Pacific tidepools  
I'm thankful that they know  
and love the ocean  
its secrets  
and the many treasures  
tossed up by the tides
