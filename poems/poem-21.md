Jeanne and Janice  
a person would scarcely  
take them for sisters  
till one of them answers  
the other one's phone  
with the other one's voice  
says Janice "our kids we can usually fool  
for a sentence or two"

Both of them funny, smart  
recently widowed  
able to live  
despite obvious differences  
of style and belief  
in apparent harmony  
sharing a house  
here in town

And now they've adopted me  
call me their brother  
although my Carroll  
was first to meet them  
we're learning each other's  
stories of marriage  
children and grandchildren  
friends and careers  
the places  
where we've spent  
the years of our lives

In a season of wildfires  
political chaos  
we find ourselves clinging  
to one another  
liberals floating about in a sea  
of Republican no-nothings  
who clearly don't care  
that their president is a serial liar  
a pompous demagogue  
who if he could  
would throw our democracy  
under the bus

They tell me they love  
the music I play  
on the nyckelharpa  
the button accordion  
songs with guitar  
with the renaissance lute  
in a time when public  
performance is out  
this has proven a gift  
for my audience-starved soul

And Jeanne  
(whose name rhymes with queenie)  
loves poetry  
lent me her book  
of Odes by Neruda  
listens attentively  
when I read my latest  
though we both know  
that I'm no Neruda  
and that's putting it mildly

The biggest and best  
of the reasons I love them  
is that they truly  
take in my Carroll  
her spirit, her depth  
the warmth of her humor  
her lively intelligence  
generous nature  
for me this is more  
than enough to endear  
these two sisters  
who now are my sisters  
forever  
and for that I'm learning  
to open my heart  
yet again
