    traditions of the Clear Lake Pomo
    	      	and Mt Lassen Maidu

It was La Mu  
the pocket gopher  
he was the one  
found sweet sounds  
in the elder's hollow stem  
hehe hehe hehe

This was way back  
when the first daylight ever  
had just emerged from darkness  
the birds and the critters  
had only their night voices  
hehe hehe hehe

Gopher man he played  
high and low on his flute  
the animals and birds  
all pricked up their ears  
each chose the tune  
that was best for her or him  
hehe hehe hehe

Robin it's said  
was the first virtuoso  
could charm the night crawlers  
right out of the ground  
hehe hehe hehe

Robin said the flute  
should only have four holes  
that would leave him three toes  
on each of his feet  
hehe hehe hehe

When Old Man Thunder  
was keeping the fire  
in his underground lodge  
it was Mouse who stole in  
put a coal in her flute  
brought fire to the people  
hehe hehe hehe

Coyote was crying  
for lack of a wife  
Earthmaker gave him  
a flute to take to bed  
It will turn into a woman  
if you wait till the dawn  
hehe hehe hehe

Coyote of course  
couldn't wait through the night  
when the flute began to change  
he reached over to her  
now he cries because all he has is the flute  
hehe hehe hehe

The elderberry flute  
isn't hard to make  
once you find the right shoot  
not too green not too old  
you can push out the pith  
trim the ends, burn the holes  
hehe hehe hehe

The trick is to find  
how to make the flute sound  
you have to stumble on it  
it's a bit of a trick  
hold the flute askew  
while you blow across the end  
hehe hehe hehe

The elderberry flute  
makes a sound soft and sweet  
speaks to the soul  
a cry from the earth  
it tells of a time  
when the world was fresh and young  
hehe hehe hehe
