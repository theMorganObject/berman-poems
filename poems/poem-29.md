Today a little fence lizard  
as brown as dirt  
scaly and speckled  
quick as a wink  
leapt from my hand  
it made me laugh  
the leaping seemed  
so wonderfully  
spontaneous

And that proved all  
I needed to  
let down my guard  
and let the day  
become a song  
the trees were singing  
while the wind  
caressed their leaves

Later I came upon  
a tiny snake  
no bigger  
than a worm  
in girth  
though twice as long  
It too lay there  
in my hand  
a moment  
then was gone

I thought how is it  
these small lives  
continue to give meaning  
to our life  
although we think ourselves  
so far above them

Perhaps part of the answer  
lies in words  
that I heard spoken  
years ago  
the words had context  
then but seem  
as true now  
as significant  
as when I heard them

The thought is simple  
God who watches all  
watches us always  
through the eyes  
of animals

Back then I thought of  
dogs and cats  
of elephants and other  
animals we choose to  
honor with intelligence

But now I think  
a bird, a lizard even  
a small snake is serving  
as a witness  
to our wisdom  
folly  
kindness, cruelty

That being so  
then the delight I took  
as a small child  
in salamanders  
lturtles, snakes  
in grasshoppers  
and beetles  
in part came from  
the sense of being seen  
by God or by the living  
world outside  
beyond the confines  
of the home

Not sensing yet the life  
within myself  
these little creatures held for me  
the quickening spirit that  
my soul was reaching for

And that's perhaps the only God  
I can imagine  
the one who watches  
through the eyes  
of animals
