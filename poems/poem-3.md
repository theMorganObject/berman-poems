The old house on five acres  
a couple miles outside of town  
only year since we left and look  
the blackberries are back  
as if they meant to overrun  
the whole damn place  
some trees have died but  
most have made it through  
the pond is dry, but given that it's August  
no surprise there  
what's surprising are the quinces  
I planted ten years back along the driveway  
a week of watering and already  
they're not just looking fresh  
they're blossoming!

All day it's quiet  
but as dusk comes on the piping  
of the tree frogs and the shrill  
cacophony of crickets  
and whatever small musicians  
the grass is hiding  
a thousand little voices  
fill the dark until it's hard to think

Too late now to move back  
our house in town is everything we wanted  
but this place with the creek  
the ponderosas, oaks, and thirty years  
of plantngs and of memories  
it's no little thing to let it go  
no little thing
