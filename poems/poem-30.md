Today we lost a champion  
another of her stature  
her tenacity, intelligence  
won't likely bless our Court  
for years to come

How tragic that her death  
should come now before he's gone  
the man who stands against  
so much she's fought for

Another ugly battle  
looms in Congress  
but for now  
let's remember her and  
simply speak her praises

Giving thanks for one  
who though absent from her post  
will be present both  
in memory and spirit

And may that spirit shake  
the callous hearts of those  
for whom justice for all  
means for the privileged

Let her memory continue  
to be a force for change  
in the heart of this  
suffering nation

I imagine her now  
on the highest court of all  
where each of us must stand  
for judgement

Then her wisdom  
her compassion  
is blessing us again  
like a good rain that ends  
a dry season
