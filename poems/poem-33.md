If artists teach our eyes to see  
with tenderness  
with clarity  
the world of forms  
of colors  
light  
the aura that delineates  
the distant hills  
the human face  
a chair a table  
sunflowers and seeds

Then poets show us where to look  
among the leaves  
for what unknowingly  
we've left behind  
or lost or in the mirror  
where the wolf  
our other self stares back at us  
with angry face yet pleading save me  
say his eyes  
and you will save yourself as well

If artists show us  
how to see a sky with clouds  
an empty field  
then poets teach us how to feel  
the tender life within the child  
that we were once  
can still embrace  
nurture and nurturing  
may learn again the innocence  
we knew the joy we felt when all  
the world was young

While artists paint  
and poets write  
then even if museums close  
and books are banned  
the world will still  
harbor the grace  
that sheds its light  
on all and gifts us  
each with eyes to see  
heaven within the flower  
the angel hidden in the face  
both of the stranger  
and the one we love
