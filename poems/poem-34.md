I have a thought  
that gravity's  
a subtle form  
of love

Love that holds on  
as bodies move  
through fearful  
distances

The moon around  
the earth around  
the sun in its  
two hundred

fifty million year spin  
circling the center  
of this pinwheel  
galaxy

And though someone  
who's falling from  
a ladder or  
a tree

Might not see things  
as I do  
deep in my bones  
I feel

The comfort of  
a mother's strong  
embrace  
holding me here

Keeping me safely  
tethered to  
the earth  
or else I float

Off into space  
but when  
with all your weight  
you lie on me

As we stretch naked  
in our bed  
and snuggle  
before sleep

Then gravity is  
all of love  
I need to  
hush all cares

You holding me  
in orbit  
as we dance  
among the stars
