Something about the way  
this gentle dog engages me  
his soft eyes searching mine  
looking for clues  
but clues to what?  
my thoughts?  
my feelings?  
clues to the human world  
so close to his  
and yet somehow  
just beyond his reach?

He lifts a paw  
extending it  
for me to take  
I hold it gently  
in my hand  
but still impatient  
still dissatisfied  
he stares as if  
I'm missing  
the whole point

Behind these gestures  
there's a question  
something deep  
that neither of us  
has yet managed  
to articulate  
Merwin's black dog  
asked "are you ready  
this time?"  
ready for what?  
the poet thought  
something to do  
with slowing down  
with not outrunning  
your own life

I don't think dogs  
have any notion  
of mortality  
yet some believe  
your dog will be the first  
to greet you  
when you reach  
the other side  
If that's my sweet Hassan  
then I'll know  
that I've arrived  
in heaven
