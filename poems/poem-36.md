Last night it rained  
today a battered  
garden

the plants bedraggled  
but the air  
washed free of smoke

too bad the rain  
didn't come  
two weeks sooner

before the fires  
destroyed so many  
homes

I think about  
my friend who lost  
so much

his instruments  
paintings he'd made  
and more

his sweet wife  
lost to cancer  
just last winter

her ashes  
lost as well now  
in the fire

My heart goes out  
to him  
and to the others  
But even late  
I'm grateful  
for the rain

I pray it brings  
along with  
cleaner air

Some solace  
to our  
recent refugees

And helps the men  
still fighting fires  
up north

So many fires  
at times it feels  
as if

the whole west coast  
were one vast  
conflagration

althought it's  
an exaggerated  
picture

hard to imagine  
things improving  
soon
