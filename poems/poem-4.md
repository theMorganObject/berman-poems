This morning coming down the stairs  
I had to wade  
through a small pool of dogs  
first our two poodles  
pleading with expectant eyea  
for an excursion to the dog park  
then our daughter Dawn's sweet-tempered pitbull  
Oakley giving me a guilty one-eyed glance  
as if to say "I know that I was wrong  
to bark at you in your own house  
but understand I'm not so used to men  
and you're still something of a stranger"  
Then there were Jay's two Yorkies  
bright-eyed, inquisitive  
their faces more child-like than dog-like  
and so tiny that they seem another species  
but oh how my dear wife has taken to them  
cuddling them as if cuddling the babes  
her daughters were a short lifetime ago  
I suspect there may be Yorkies in our future  
and I'll just have to learn to see them  
for the dogs they are
