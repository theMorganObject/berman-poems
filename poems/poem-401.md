Out of the blue  
your book came in the mail  
caught me off balance  
like the unexpected slap  
of a Zen master  
which of course you were  
and are as long as buddha dharma lasts  
Instructions to the Cook  
a title echoing  
the great D≈çgen  
whose writing still can make  
my hair stand up  
though you and I'd not met  
you wrote Dear Steve  
Please prepare the supreme meal!  
only later I learned  
how over years  
you'd fed the bodies  
hearts and minds  
of hungry souls  
manifesting in the slums  
of New York city  
the bodhisattva path  
thinking of you tonight  
I'm renewing my old vow  
to make myself as savory  
and nourishing as my poor skills allow
