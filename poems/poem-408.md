No blue so deep so vivid  
as the waters  
of Vineyard Haven harbor  
looking down  
from the top deck  
of our departing ferry  
clear azure sparkling  
in the August sunlight  
a perfect backdrop for the hundred  
white-hulled sailboats  
tethered behind the jetty  
gently rocking  
in the ripples of our wake  
as we pull slowly  
from the dock leaving behind  
the island of my childhood loves  
and dreams
