Such a delight  
this plague of butterflies  
that overnight invaded our back garden  
feeding alongside the honeybees  
perching for mere seconds at a time  
on the yellow hearts  
of purple-hued chrysanthemums  
they've earned their name  
these tiny jewels that skip  
from flower to flower  
with just a flicking  
of their double wings  
they pay me scant attention  
as I approach looking for the signs  
patterns that might distinguish them  
from their too numerous sisters  
and cousins  
though just why it is I need to know  
the precise name given the simple pleasure  
of watching them flit about  
in their quick and skittish ways  
that's something even to myself  
I can't explain
