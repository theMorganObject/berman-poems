Cool nights and shorter days  
remind us  
time to gather in our memories  
of summer's gifts  
the garden with it's ever  
shifting colors  
a world of roses  
floribundas pink  
and white rugosas  
apple scented eglantine  
great clumps of guara  
blossoms dancing  
on long stalks  
and black-eyed susans  
purple peonies and spikes  
of dark blue sage

With the Covid we stayed home  
but in July a hike  
along the Rogue  
my wife  
our daughter  
baby still inside  
and daughter's husband  
the two dogs off leash  
leading the way  
and when it got too warm  
we stripped and swam  
letting the current  
carry cares away  
it's hard to say who  
was the happier  
we humans or the dogs  
the river flowing strong  
dark green with flecks of silver  
heading toward the sea

Tonight with the full moon  
this harvest of  
delicious memories  
offsets somewhat the news  
the plague that's killing thousands  
every day the numbers rising with  
no end in sight  
and we who've yet to lose  
a friend or loved one  
feel our hearts go out  
to those who've suffered  
losses in this troubled time  
and pray that it  
may soon be over  
even as we thank the gods  
of summer for their many gifts
