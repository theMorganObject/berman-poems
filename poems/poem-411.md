The giant's had a dream and knows  
his time has come  
but first he wants his matted hair  
brushed smooth  
the lice combed out  
and maybe a last shave  
to calm his nerves  
so he can go  
if not in style at least  
looking his best  
and anyway the knight  
who's just arrived  
should show at least  
a modicum of chivalry  
before he cuts the giants head  
off at the neck
