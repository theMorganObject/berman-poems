// version 1
Just past the autumn equinox the bees  
are moving through the garden  
flower to flower  
alighting on blue sage  
and yellow daisies  
on purple dahlias and  
gold chrysanthemums  
harvesting the summer's  
sweet remains  
the fruits of July's sunshine  
August's heat  
and last weeks rains  
that washed away the dust  
clearing the air of smoke  
from distant fires  
the bees are hard at work  
as if aware  
that winter will soon see them  
in retreat  
and I too sense the dark days  
coming on  
and feel a need to gather what I can  
of memories and dreams  
thoughts and reflections  
pollen to turn to honey  
in the hive  
bee bread to feed the life  
that waits for spring  
to stretch new wings and fly
