On a dark night I dove  
hoping to find the sail  
my boat had lost  
when it capsized  
it had to be there  
just below me  
though I couldn't see  
two feet before my eyes  
then suddenly I found myself descending  
a flight of stairs  
between pink walls  
along a corridor  
leading me God knows where  
though it was clear  
I had to follow  
however eager I might be  
to find my way  
back to the surface  
and as the stairs began to climb  
I passed a room  
its white door shut  
inside I heard two women  
in quiet consultation  
voices muffled but I thought  
I recognized the one and wishing  
to escape unnoticed  
I crept by on tiptoe  
no longer thinking of the sail  
and with no warning  
woke up in my bed
