is nothing  
you can find online  
or in the local library  
rather it's knowledge born  
of the immense mycelial world  
that's hidden underground  
of which we know only  
the evanescent fruits though even they  
have much to tell us  
some open our eyes  
to see the world  
as if a new creation  
is the wonder that we feel  
out there or in ourselves?  
but there is no in or out  
it's like our first discovery  
of sex and sexual love  
when dewy eyed we see the world  
as if we'd just been born  
and heard as if for the first time  
love singing through our veins  
our every cell awakened now  
and joining in the song
