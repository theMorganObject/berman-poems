The river was a spool of silk brocade  
unwinding from a reel somewhere upstream  
the surface ruffled  
slightly as the wind rose  
shaking down a cloud of needles  
from the pines  
the geese seemed to be coasting  
on the windgusts  
but it was the mergansers  
caught my eye  
out along the far bank lifting off  
and splashing down  
as if on cue the little flock would slip  
beneath the surface  
diving in unison like a school  
of tiny porpoises  
I'd watch while we sat chatting  
sipping wine with friends  
an easy stone's throw  
from the water's edge  
surrounded by the scent  
of autumn leaf-fall  
were they frolicking or  
was it life and death  
were they successful  
in their hunt  
no way for me to tell  
but their swift movements  
were a ballet synchronized  
so perfectly  
that even though a bit rude  
to our hostess  
I found it hard to take my eyes away
