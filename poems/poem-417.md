A Song for the Rogue

Elliot was right about the river  
at least today  
after the first fall rains  
it truly is a strong brown god  
though I would argue  
neither sullen nor looking  
to be tamed  
intractable perhaps and forceful yes  
its lithe bronze body flowing  
effortless  
the way a python glides across  
the forest floor  
or clouds stream overhead  
in a windstorm  
the Rogue descends  
from high in the Cascades  
through corridors of basalt  
and blue serpentine  
whitewater riffles mark its progress  
to the coast  
where finally it broadens  
and slips past  
the harbor at Gold Beach  
to empty out  
into the wide Pacific  
free at last
