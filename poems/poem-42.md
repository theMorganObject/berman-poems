Here's a guitar whose lines are lovely  
the purfling jet black and green  
the rose as well - both edged in white  
striped maple back and sides  
spruce top fine grained  
frets ebony and bone  
ebony pegs and rosewood bridge  
no label only through the soundhole  
Petitjean Paris

Its tones are rich with age - no marvel  
given it's two hundred years  
in early life its strings were gut  
now nylon - stronger  
but without the warmth

I have to wonder through what hands  
it's travelled - clearly it's been well loved  
small and light compared with modern  
instruments its voice is helping me to hear  
more clearly feel more deeply  
the music of its time

Fernando Sor played a guitar  
like this one - it was his music drew me  
when I first set out  
sixty-five years later it still moves me as much  
or even more than then - his counterpoint  
the lyric beauty of his lines  
his balancing of strength and tender passion  
have made his music my life study  
and the consolation of my idle hours

To own and play an instrument  
from Sor's own time  
it is as if my life has circled  
round again completing in its arc  
a healing purpose beyond anything  
I would have come to on my own

Now it's the guitar teaching my fingers  
where all the subtle beauties lie  
how to coax those gentle voices  
to sing out clear across the centuries
