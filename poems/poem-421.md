for Pablo Neruda  
Look at you sprawling sloppily  
across the lower garden  
your oversized leaves drooping  
after the first fall rains  
signalling it's time  
to gather in those fleshy stems  
that I so love for their astringency  
their sweetly bitter taste  
so delicious chunked and baked  
in pie or cobbler  
all summer you've been quick to advertise  
your thirst by wilting overnight  
if we forgot to water you  
and so we worked  
to keep you healthy and alive  
you've done us proud  
now you can count on us  
to help you make  
that final leap up to the table  
to fulfill at last  
your culinary destiny
