The lute I play is from  
the Renaissance  
in its design that is  
eight courses  
fifteen strings  
Bach would have known the lute  
that his friend Weiss  
composed for  
still more strings  
a different sound  
but my lute too  
would have sounded familiar  
to Bach's ears  
more than any piano  
or six-string guitar  
and when I play a movement  
from his suites for cello  
it's seems as if the lute  
was never far from the composer's mind  
although I don't dispute  
the cello's greater resonance  
the lute offers the pleasure  
of sweet melody and chordal  
harmonies combined
