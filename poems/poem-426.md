A steady scattering  
of honeybees and skippers  
have spent the morning milking  
the sage's deep blue flowers  
long slender cups extending  
from their papery black sepals  
jewels set along the spikes  
that rise up from the leaves  
I sit back in my garden chair  
watching the busy sippers  
and gatherers of pollen  
plying their subtle craft  
insects and flowers glowing  
in the warm October sunshine  
the quiet broken only  
by the whirr of tiny wings  
my mind emptied of thoughts  
distills the morning's nectar  
not drowsy only lulled  
by the stillness of the hour
