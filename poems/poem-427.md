That's my wife there  
in the photo  
kneeling beside her sister's headstone  
Linda who died too young  
and who I'm told  
did not complain  
except to say once  
knowing she had little time  
that she felt cheated  
which of course was true

They were the closest friends  
and now my wife  
is tasked with placing flowers  
real of course not plastic  
on her sister's grave  
in this quaint country town  
where we come only rarely  
but then Linda's with us  
in our home and for my wife  
remains a source of memories  
and feelings mostly happy  
sometimes sad or bittersweet  
it's now been twenty years  
and she's no otherworldly ghost  
rather a living presence  
one with whom we share  
at times I think unknowingly  
our sorrows and our joys
