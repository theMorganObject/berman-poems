They play  
with such exhuberance  
young pups  
and old timers alike  
chasing eachother up  
and down  
and all around the field  
while we the owners  
stand off to the side  
enjoying their enthusiasm  
for the balls we throw  
and chatting easily with strangers  
as we hardly would  
were we not all of us  
dog people
