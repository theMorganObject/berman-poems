What I miss most  
leaving behind our country home  
isn't the garden with its classic roses  
the fruit trees - Queen Anne cherries  
Fujis, Santa Rosa plums  
It isn't even the turtles diving  
from their log  
or the heron come to dine  
on frogs and little fish  
and not the brilliant dragonflies playing  
above the water lilies  
or the pileated woodpeckers  
with their nesting young  
although that's certainly a loss  
nor the deer with their dark eyes  
grazing calmly in the north pasture  
none of these come so vividly to mind  
as the cries day after day  
hour after hour  
of the sharp-shinned hawk  
calling and calling  
calling to her mate
