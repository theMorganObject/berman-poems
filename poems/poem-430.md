It's a week  
since the last day of Sukkot  
and I've been slow  
to take the sukkah down  
not for laziness  
but feeling a reluctance  
to let it go  
it was so sweet to sit there  
for eight nights  
lighting candles  
making kiddush  
singing in Hebrew  
and in Yiddish  
inviting in my dead  
and all the holy ancestors  
the ushpizin  
but now the green palm fronds  
are dry and brown  
time to take apart the loose  
scaffolding and lathe  
scrape up the candlewax  
that dripped down on the deck  
put away the ornaments  
the birds and beads and flowers  
that made the sukkah  
seem a work of art  
and to savor one last time  
in memory  
this celebration of the turning  
of the year
