Once hitchhiking outside of Anchorage  
I stopped beside a pond  
not large but lovely  
calm and pristine  
as any I have known  
it was in May  
and I remember sunlight flashing  
off the wings of a lone tern  
that swooped and dove  
and suddenly out of the stillness  
heard the crack  
of a beaver's tail slapping the water  
a sound so sharp and clear it woke me  
from my revery  
as if I'd just been slapped  
lightly across the face  
it was perhaps the first  
though not the only time  
that I've been rudely shaken  
from my dream  
and if only for a moment  
seen the world made new
