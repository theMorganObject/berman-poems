The year we lived in Moscow  
it was his songs  
I learned my Russian from  
politically suspect  
they passed from friend to friend  
on reel to reel  
a gentle plaintive voice  
backed up by the few chords  
and mostly minor keys  
he knew on his guitar  
he sang the sorrows  
and stupidity of war  
the bitterness of love's betrayals  
and the ways in which so much  
slips through our inept fingers  
he sang about a cat  
whose eyes were dangerous  
whose whiskers hid a smile  
you'd best not meet  
he sang life's steady drumbeat  
hard to hear  
amid the hum and bustle of a city  
such as the Moscow  
that he loved and celebrated  
his songs are from another age  
but still come back at times  
bringing with them memories of the lonliness  
that was my constant shadow  
through my eighteenth year
