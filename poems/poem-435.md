Even now  
after we'd danced  
a lifetime's dances  
and the tunes  
seemed all old hat  
and we were ready  
to sit back  
and take it easy  
suddenly  
the morning light  
came through the curtains  
saying look  
it's a new day  
wake up and see  
what you have never  
seen before  
the sunlight glancing  
off the rooftop of the house  
next door and playing  
with the pine that lifts its candles  
to the sun  
as if in worship  
you're not dead  
you're still in transit  
at this unfamiliar port  
you thought you knew  
but look again  
there's so much more  
so much you've missed  
in all your haste  
this is your chance  
take it to heart  
don't let it go to waste
