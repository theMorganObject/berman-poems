Tonight it feels as if the well's run dry  
or is it just the lateness of the hour?  
it's hard to know if now's the time to scour  
my mind for metaphors to see me by

Or else to put aside what would have been  
my pen if I'd been living in an age  
before things digital became the rage  
but what the point comparing now and then

Besides I can't deny the greater ease  
for one like me who flunked my sixth grade course in penmanship nor have I since perforce  
improved my caligraphic expertise

So even if the poetry is lost  
and silly rhyming's standing in its stead  
I'm grateful given my too empty head  
how little effort these few lines have cost
