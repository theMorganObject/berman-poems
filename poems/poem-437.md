Driving the country road  
that skirts the Applegate  
sweet river running clear  
as it meanders  
on its way to join the Rogue  
the mid-October sun  
setting the air  
a-shimmer as I drove  
homeward and happy  
along the valley floor  
I passed a sign  
that advertised ripe melons  
beside a roadside farm stand  
with a wealth of vegetables and fruit  
set out on tables  
no one keeping tabs  
but prices noted  
and a box for folks  
to leave their money in  
I thought how lovely  
both the harvest and the trust  
and wondered with the heat  
the summer fires  
and talk of the new normal  
would there be a farm  
like this one selling fruit  
in thirty years  
when my grandchildren have reached  
their parents' age  
and felt a pang of conscience  
but soon washed over  
by a wave of gratitude  
for all the season's gifts  
the harvest of the farms  
the ripened grapes  
with their promise of new wine  
the senses quickening  
as chilly nights  
and days of crystal clarity  
set miles of maple trees aflame
