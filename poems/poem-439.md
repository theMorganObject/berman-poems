Back when I was a boy  
of six or eight or ten  
all summer long  
from mid-June to September  
I ran barefoot on the beaches at Katama  
Menemsha, Chappaquiddik  
Tashmoo and our Lagoon Pond  
during those childhood years  
of all the sea life caught  
and held between my fingers  
puffer fish and eels  
sand sharks and scallops  
it was the hermit crabs  
I found most fascinating  
the way they seemed to glide  
across the sandy bottom  
pulling back into their shells  
when I would pick them up  
then snapping with their tiny claws  
in self defense  
while softer body parts  
stayed safely curled  
deep in the shell  
until the need for a more spacious home  
compelled the little crab  
to risk a quick dash in the open  
just the time required  
to occupy a new and bigger shell  
as I look back  
across the epochs of my life  
I see the hermit crab I've been  
holed for years until something compelled me  
then coming out of my safe shell  
just long enough  
to squeeze into the next
