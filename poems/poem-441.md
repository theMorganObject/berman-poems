Dwarfing the tiny scuba diver  
a whaleshark glides across my laptop screen  
immense and beautiful in her proportions  
her colors and her graceful tail and fins  
ambassador of oceanic kingdoms  
accompanied by schools of underlings  
her movements speak an undeciphered language  
the echoing of silences and sounds  
unheard by human ears throughout a thousand  
ages - only now have we begun  
to learn the secrets of this other planet  
whose darkest mysteries mirror our own
