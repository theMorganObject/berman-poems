one would think  
that being a writer  
a serious one that is  
was some kind of curse  
an affliction  
of the hypersensitive or those  
of melancholy disposition  
and while with him I sense  
a depth of insight  
not to mention erudition  
far beyond my paltry gifts  
I'm not convinced  
or at least not entirely
