For Carroll On Her Purchase Of A House In Morgantown WV of a House in Morgantown WV

Goddess that she is  
my wife has got it all  
the evens and the odds  
the highs and lows  
the mattresses and sheets  
the soft pillows  
for the new Ikea bed  
a lamp and silverware  
a kitchen table and four matching chairs  
all this for the old house she's bought  
in Morgantown  
just down the street  
from where our daughter lives  
who soon will bring  
her firstborn baby home  
a granddaughter!  
and to christen the new digs  
a set of wineglasses  
a corkscrew  
and from the old country  
a bottle of Montepulciano
