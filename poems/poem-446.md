We know nothing of the man  
who fashioned it  
or its first use  
in any case that was at least  
a hundred years ago  
this elegant oak rocker  
with its morticed joints  
its curves and rich brown staining  
that my wife found on craigslist  
and with our granddaughter  
due in three weeks it clearly merited  
the drive into the Alleghenies  
where we bought it  
from a West Virginia matron  
who remembered how she'd rocked  
her baby daughter  
now the mother of a teenage girl  
in this same chair  
which even then had long  
been in the family  
and now will once again be put to use  
and perhaps passed along  
to future generations  
a work of craftsmanship  
worthy of our respect  
I'd say even a touch of reverence
