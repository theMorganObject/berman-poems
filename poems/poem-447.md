From the bank I watched  
as the white kayak  
settled in the grey salt waters of the pond  
near to the shore and sank  
together with it's passengers  
a woman and her infant child  
I stood there at a loss  
thinking they must have drowned  
but then my son came forward  
and without hesitation  
stepped in and pulled them out  
I held the baby in my arms  
as to my surprise  
it came back to life  
began to cry  
the woman too came slowly  
back from her drowned state  
although a stranger  
I could see that she was Japanese  
and reassured her  
that her baby was alive  
and would be alright  
on waking I thought here's a dream  
worth living with  
awhile and pondering
