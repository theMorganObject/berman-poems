We were married once  
me and Louisa  
and had a child  
though it seems I was a pisspoor father  
which may be why it didn't last  
and she was older  
which might not have suited  
but what of the child  
was it a girl? I don't remember  
it's embarrassing  
at least that's was the feeling  
in my dream  
upon waking I asked my wife  
since there was no-one I could conjur  
by that name  
until I thought of BBC's Doc Martin  
and his love Louisa  
who on the screen becomes his wife  
and mother of his child  
so I wondered if it had to do with things  
I shared with that eccentric English doctor  
so intelligent and useful in emergencies  
but who treated everyone as if  
they must be stupid  
thanks to his inability to recognize  
the symptoms of his mild  
but obvious autism  
something I'm only just coming to know  
in myself  
and so perhaps the dream  
but then today  
just one day later here's Luisa  
without the "o" brought back to life  
by the intrepid literary archeologist  
excavator of other lives  
Winfried Sebald in his book The Emigrants  
this Luisa sent a trove of memories  
handwritten - of her childhood and her early years  
to her son Max  
whom Sebald came to know in Manchester  
the pages - Sebald quotes from them at length  
offer a glimpse into a world the war destroyed  
and whose traces the Germans have since  
done much to erase

Luisa Ferber n√©e Lanzberg  
daughter of a German Jewish family  
solid middle-class  
in 1936 her mother Lisa  
perhaps forseeing what the future held  
took her own life  
her father, husband and herself shipped out  
and murdered in the Nazi camps in '42  
the year I was conceived  
Max had escaped to England three years earlier  
his mother's memoires  
written toward the end  
when she clearly knew  
what was in store  
and then passed on by Max  
to Sebald after half a century  
strange for this Luisa to show up  
the day after my dream
