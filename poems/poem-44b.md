In younger years  
I had no clue  
how to be friends  
with anyone  
especially with women

my wife would say  
it had to do with  
being on the spectrum  
but I suspect  
I simply didn't make the effort

It's different now  
when every friendship  
seems so precious  
that I'm afraid to lose the few  
good friends I have

But Roma says  
our friendship is secure  
and so I think it's up to me  
to keep in touch  
now that she's moving  
to another city  
especially since I'm the needier  
or at least the more  
enamored of the gifts  
that have accompanied our friendship  
music, fine cuisine,  
good conversation  
and by the way  
I'm pretty sure this  
charming doctor  
once saved my life but that's  
another story altogether

Endgame

Not there yet  
but I can see it coming  
as more pieces leave the board  
knights swapped for bishops  
pawns exchanged for pawns  
or sacrificed to gain  
some small advantage

With the board less cluttered  
the options become clearer  
though it's easy to miscalculate  
and every move carries more weight

Along the way I've lost my queen  
more than just once  
but this one is my last  
and my best hope  
and though the ending's  
hardly unforseeable  
I recognize the only  
real opponent  
it's someone whom  
I've lived with  
all my life

poem 45 - The Owl

Ten p.m.  
the sound of wings  
beating the window  
behind my head  
I turned to look  
Rachel I said  
there's an owl  
we had been talking  
on the phone  
long distance

No hesitation on her part  
her words  
ask what it's bringing  
what it wants to take away  
I ran out outside  
no owl in sight  
next morning though  
sitting in medition  
it was back  
not physically this time  
there was a place  
it wanted me to go

A place a mile  
from where I lived  
or maybe two  
above the beach  
hidden by trees  
thick underbrush

when I crawled through  
on hands and knees  
I found myself  
looking down a hundred feet  
through a great cleft  
a rock split down the center  
like a cliff  
but reaching far  
into the earth

I sat there taken  
with the power of the place  
then in my ear  
my uncle's voice  
It's uncle Hal  
the voice said  
all my life  
I wanted just  
to live on air and now  
I am the air and the sea mist  
that blows along the shore  
and Stephen it's so wonderful  
so wonderful !
