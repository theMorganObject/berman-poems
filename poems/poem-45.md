After half the pawns have left the board  
leaving a few that yet may reach  
the other side  
replacing what you've lost  
maybe a castle or a queen

And after bishops have been swapped  
for knights and knights for bishops  
then you're down to a board that's  
nearly empty and it's easier  
to see the options

Now every move seems weightier  
more fraught with consequences  
and though the end may be  
a given the important thing  
is how the game is played  
better if no cheating  
but with ingenuity and your share  
of laughter

If your opponent's white then you  
are black and vice versa  
it hardly matters  
you may win for a while  
but there's no stalemate  
in this game

As you get down to  
the last moves  
it's no small blessing  
if you still have your queen
