How many bones  
will you have when you're born?  
and how long before you can smile?  
Will you be bald? Will your eyes brown  
like your mother's or blue like dad's?  
It's so close now  
I can't wait to meet you!

Still only BAM  
I'm sure your parents will decide  
on something better soon  
but I confess this nickname  
does remind me of how much  
has changed so quickly  
in the months since we  
first heard of you

Imagining my wife  
your grandma Carroll  
holding you while rocking  
in the antique rocker  
she bought specially  
for the two of you  
brings me a moment's  
quiet joy
