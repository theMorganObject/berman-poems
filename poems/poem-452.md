After a day spent  
screwdriver in hand  
piecing together the Ikea bed  
I found it a delight  
as evening fell  
to welcome trick-or-treaters  
at our door  
neighborhood children dressed  
as tigers, pirates  
witches, ghosts and ghouls  
the parents close behind  
looking on with pride and pleasure  
as their youngsters reveled  
in what seemed little more  
than a masked candy grab  
yet there is something more  
something as ancient  
as the tribal world  
with its economy of gift exchange  
and there's the power  
of a mask to change reality  
to create another very different self  
no wonder we remember them  
as magical  
our childhood walkabouts  
on Halloween
