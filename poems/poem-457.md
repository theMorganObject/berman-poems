Two weeks away  
came home to a changed world  
the maple trees we left behind  
close cousins  
of the burning bush  
Moses beheld  
are now bereft of color  
save for their skeletons  
of winter grey  
the garden looking sodden  
in the rain  
still shows the varied colors  
of the fall  
though more subdued  
yellows and reds  
in the remaining leaves  
of blueberries  
deep pink of the chrysanthemums  
the holly trees as always evergreen  
and one tall sage with spikes  
of purple flowers  
bedraggled but considered worthy nonetheless  
of a visit from a still resident hummingbird  
since snow is rarely in the works  
here in Grants Pass  
this is the look of winter  
best get used to it
