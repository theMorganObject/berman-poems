Crossing the road they trot  
along the cul-de-sac  
the two of them  
until we reach the wooden steps  
that take us down  
to where the ditch  
thanks to recent rains  
is full again  
the water barely flowing  
under a canopy of firs and pines  
the dogs are frisky  
happy to be out  
noses exploring the rich olfactory world  
as for me my eyes are drawn  
to where madrones  
have hung their clusters  
of pale orange berries  
that shimmer in the dark  
green of the foliage  
the path beneath our feet  
a brown mosaic  
of oak leaves and fir needles  
the air smells fresh with rain  
and at this hour  
no birdsong cuts the silence  
now the dogs  
are ready to turn back  
they run ahead  
leave me to trail behind
