It's a year to the day  
since cancer took you  
from your loving husband  
from us all

The hollow you left  
in our hearts  
is beyond repair

The memory of your laughter  
brings a smile to anyone  
fortunate enough  
to have heard it

Your wifely devotion  
to a husband whose  
love for you  
was and is boundless  
but still we know  
all marriages have their  
rocky shoals their gaps  
so those of us  
who have loved and love  
your Daniel  
feel a debt of gratitude  
for all the years  
all the gifts  
you blessed him with

Today as we remember you  
your youthful spirit  
gracious and graceful  
movement through the world  
we feel our own lives deepy blessed  
by all these gifts  
and so we offer thanks and praise  
even as we grieve our loss
