Such a treasure  
this small piece of paradise  
hidden in the forest  
high above the valley  
peaceful with the gentle  
sound of small waves lapping  
the shores of blue-grey serpentine

Surely it's time  
to find a different name  
one that's less fraught  
with racist history  
perhaps what native peoples  
called it while they still  
lived here in peace

Today we scattered ashes  
of our sweet friend Carolyn  
lost to us a year ago  
though doctors tried to save her life  
cancer had the last word  
except for those we heard just now  
spoken by her grieving husband  
Daniel whose loving tribute  
this time carried the day

The ashes sank from sight  
the many-colored flowers we threw  
floated on the surface  
blown along by the breeze  
afterwards Daniel  
took off his clothes  
as I did mine  
braving the lake's October chill  
we felt our bodies quickened  
our spirits lifted by the cold

Back at the car we said goodbyes  
I thought yes every day  
one more goodbye  
goodbye dear Carolyn  
and thank you  
for your many gifts  
your loving presence  
gracious spirit  
and for reminding us how precious  
these brief moments of our life  
while we're still here  
to share with friends  
and loved ones  
the exquisite beauty  
of this mountain lake
