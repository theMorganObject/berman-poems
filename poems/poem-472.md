Back on the coast
after what seems a year  
though it was only half of that  
still I'd nearly forgotten  
how much I love the beaches  
with their wealth  
of driftwood  
broken clamshells  
bits of crab and kelp  
sand dollars sometimes whole  
the sound the waves make  
as they break  
the hissing  
as the surge recedes  
the way the light  
plays on the ocean surface  
and the delight our dogs take  
in the chase  
running wildly after gulls  
knowing they'll never catch them  
just excited to be  
filling the air with beating wings
