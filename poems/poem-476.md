Merwin said it  
better than I ever could  
how in our hurry  
we miss out  
on almost everything  
that's the best argument for poetry  
that I can think of  
nothing else  
not even love  
has slowed the pace  
with which I've wolfed it down  
this sensuous feast  
spread out before my eyes  
and I a ravening beast  
greedy for knowledge  
for experience  
fearful of losing out  
if I hold back  
but now I'm starting  
once again to learn  
what I knew as a child  
when I'd spend hours  
waiting to feel a tugging on the dropline  
I'd let sink to the bottom  
out of sight  
it's not the poem  
pulled up from the deep  
and flopping on the dock  
its colors quickly fading  
it's the inner ocean pulsating  
with hidden life  
its currents vibrating  
between my fingers
