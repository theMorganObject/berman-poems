Lost on backcountry roads  
that wound through farmlands  
north of Sacramento  
worked myself into a tizzy  
when by chance  
I looked up and  
above the stubble  
of the dry November fields  
snow geese  
perhaps a hundred  
spread out in a ragged line  
their bodies seafoam  
wingtips dipped in india ink  
so unexpected and so  
lovely in their flight  
a moment's grace  
that turned the day around
