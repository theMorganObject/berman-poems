Coyote learned the hard way  
as he always learned  
or failed to learn  
life's lessons  
waking in his den  
well hidden  
just above the river  
after a night alone  
he stumbled out  
and shouted to a fellow standing  
in the distance  
on the far bank  
Hey you what's the news?  
The news? Oh there's no news  
only that Coyote  
sucked himself off  
last night back in his den  
oh thought Coyote  
now they'll be no end  
of gossip  
folks laughing at me  
behind my back  
since then it's been that way  
for all of us  
no secrets  
not of that kind anyway
