When the current catches you  
sweeps you away  
from the familiar shore  
no point in fighting  
best go with it  
if you're lucky  
you'll survive the falls  
avoid the rocks  
the rapids  
let it take you down  
to where you have a chance  
of angling your way  
back to the bank  
a bit shook up  
but none the worse for wear  
and once you've coughed  
the water from your lungs  
and caught your breath  
you're eager to head out  
ready to scout the contours  
of the new terrain  
it seems the world is wider  
wilder than you knew  
more convoluted  
more alluring  
but before you start  
now is the time to thank the river  
for its gift
