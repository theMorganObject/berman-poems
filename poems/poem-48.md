Dream or waking vision  
I don't remember  
but the light  
streaming from her face  
was almost blinding

Stephen it's your  
great-grandmother Caroline  
assigned to watch over you  
my penance for neglecting  
your grandfather  
when he was a boy

That was forty years ago  
later I stumbled on  
the girlish diary she'd kept  
back in the 1870s

Inside the cover  
her signature  
Carrie  
same name and spelling  
that my sweet wife Carroll  
goes by among her family

A coincidence yes  
but is it only that?

All I know  
is that my wife  
my Carrie  
is for sure  
my guardian angel
