This lovely man  
retired hand surgeon  
husband and father  
who dotes on his two daughters  
so we speak of them awhile  
their schooling and their work  
and I can't help but wonder  
just a bit why neither  
of the two is married  
or has children  
but of this  
not a word escapes my lips  
mostly we talk  
of books we're reading  
recent movies  
things we share  
though he knows more  
than I of actors  
actresses and films  
we used to try  
conversing in Italian  
now we stick to English  
and imagine travelling  
perhaps together  
in the south of Italy  
meanwhile the food  
has come and we forget  
if only for an hour  
the pandemic and  
the need to wear a mask  
but it's the seeming normalcy  
of this busy restaurant  
that strikes us both  
as something strange  
almost unnerving  
although early on  
we shared our thoughts  
about the risk we might be taking  
we agreed that it was slight  
and so are happy in the end  
to order coffee and dessert  
to take our time  
since our wives are out of town  
and both of us are heading  
back to empty homes  
all the more reason  
to enjoy a meal with such a friend
