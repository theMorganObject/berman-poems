Whatever we might think  
we're not alone  
there's always someone at our side  
an unseen friend  
perhaps an angel  
or the one that Socrates  
referred to as his daimon  
spirit guide  
whose presence  
makes it possible to do  
the work we're here to do

Rumi caught it with his story  
of the basket weaver  
who mistaken for a thief  
his hand cut off  
went on weaving baskets  
and if someone watched  
they'd swear an unseen hand  
worked alongside  
two hands together dancing  
in perfect tandem  
a magic tale? only for those of us  
still new or unaccustomed to the work
