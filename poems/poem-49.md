Who was the woman of my dream  
wanting to make a child with me  
we two in bed  
both with our clothes on  
no sex no love but a great feeling  
of respect and sympathy

Her house was set in barren hills  
a silver lake but without trees  
I asked her how she felt about  
being so distant from the sea

And how she wished to go about this  
I could manage either way  
make love or bring her what she needed  
she said she'd talk it over  
with her husband when he returned  
later that day

So I left to drive away  
but I'd forgotten wallet and keys  
and only then did I remember  
I'd had my tubes tied years before  
embarrassing - how could I not  
have thought of this when she first asked  
if I would do this thing for her

Went back up the stairs to tell her  
found her in tears and had no heart  
to blurt out the truth  
just took my wallet and my keys  
and drove away
