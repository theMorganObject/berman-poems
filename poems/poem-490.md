A quick saliva swab  
and here's the news  
I'm three percent neanderthal  
is it my hair?  
the color of my eyes?  
where should I look  
to find this ancestor  
what do we know  
about these kinfolk  
closest of our cousins  
seems the picture changes  
from one year to the next  
the more we learn  
about them and about ourselves  
the less reason we have to flaunt  
our cleverness  
had they survived I can imagine  
their descendents finding out  
they carry sapiens genes  
would it be three percent?  
that number doesn't count  
the ninety-nine point seven  
percent of genes we share  
we were so close!  
and we have yet to learn  
how much of who they were  
lives on in us
