The little tree that gave so generously  
only last August  
has put forth a fresh offering of fruit  
pale yellow globes  
that hang like Christmas ornaments  
only less gaudy  
and more beautiful  
half hidden in the leaves  
as if from modesty  
more than a dozen  
lime green when last I looked  
now lemon yellow  
ripe and asking to be picked  
I trust the incandescent bulb I hung  
will provide warmth  
on these cold nights  
the the longest of the year
