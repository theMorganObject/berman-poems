This time the chicken  
cooked and cut up  
into boneless chunks  
mixed in a bowl with long-grain rice  
is for the dogs  
sweet littermates  
that have begun to show  
signs of old age  
a weakness in the joints  
the need for something  
more than their customary kibbles  
for myself I keep the chicken bones  
thrown in a pot  
with carrots, onions, celery  
Italian herbs  
and simmered for an hour  
in salted broth  
the dogs seem happy  
but I've come away  
feeling I snatched the best part  
of the bargain
