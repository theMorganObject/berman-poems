Many are the silences I love  
the forest on a windless day  
in mid-December  
when the birds  
have ceased their chatter  
and the fog  
softens and blurs the outlines  
of the trees  
and those moments of silence  
between friends  
or lovers holding close  
no need for talk  
the quiet says enough  
but there are those  
whose purpose is to hurt  
to shut one out  
a cruel withholding of the words  
that might bring healing  
and of course  
there are those larger silences  
whole countries keep  
rather than admit to histories  
too painful to remember  
horrors of war and genocide  
atrocities commited in the name  
of some religious myth or national interest  
or simply for enrichment  
like the Opium Wars  
the list goes on  
but as a music lover  
I listen for the silence  
that's behind the notes  
and which the music needs  
the way that lightning needs  
to flash within the depths  
of a dark nighttime sky
