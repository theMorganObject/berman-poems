Here words fail utterly  
to show the gratitude  
the love I feel  
since you yourself have been  
as great a gift  
as life could give  
though I have never quite  
known to hold up my end  
you in your wisdom  
knew what to take  
and what to leave  
what more could any father  
hope for from his son  
you've been a blessing  
from the first  
so now I offer mine:

A joyous birthday  
a sweet week  
the Christmas tree spreading its light  
throughout the house  
lifting your heart  
above all worries  
all concerns  
and as the solstice marks the start  
of spring's return so may you feel  
the new life starting even now  
deep within the nurturing soil
