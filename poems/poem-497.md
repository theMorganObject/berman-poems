In twenty-seventeen we drove  
on winding roads  
from Chiavary into the hills  
just inland from the Cinque Terre  
to the village of Zerli  
where my wife's nana lived  
until her parents sent her off to San Francisco  
to join an older sister  
at age twelve  
and by some miracle we found the house  
abandoned many years  
and met the neighbors  
who lived across the road

My Italian just enough  
for simple conversation  
I spoke a while with an old-timer living down  
below the neighbor's house  
he offered us  
a sample of his home made grappa  
and went on  
a bit about his work in the ship yards  
during the war  
I had the sense the wartime years  
he'd spent in Genoa and further south  
were the great moment of his life  
as we were leaving  
he pointed to a spot off in the trees  
lining the ravine  
that's where my brother died  
he told me  
when the Americans flew over  
and dropped their bombs
