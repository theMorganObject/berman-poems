No way to put in words  
the grace and beauty of these elk  
as they ford the neighbors fence  
not leaping, not like deer  
but flowing like a river over rocks  
buff rumps rising smoothly  
the herd sire keeping watch  
as cows and calves  
move through in perfect rhythm  
I watch them in the dusk light  
no thoughts, no mind, just wonder  
just the moment  
just alive
