    				Recuerdos de la Alhambra

Memories of the Alhambra  
was the name  
Tarrega gave to  
this little jewel of the  
guitar repertory

Throughout the soaring melody  
the tremolo projects  
a beautiful illusion of sustain

And if you're blessed to wander  
through the Alhambra's gardens  
sunlit with roses and with water  
splashing in the graceful fountains

Remembering the music  
you'll hear more clearly  
vividly the water's many voices  
while the memory of the gardens  
will delightfully infuse  
your hearing of Tarrega's Recuerdos
