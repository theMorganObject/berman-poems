What a delight!  
a travel ban enforced  
only by stormy weather - a reminder  
of those days when schools were closed  
because of snow and we children  
released from indoor classrooms  
made the proverbial snowmen with coal eyes  
and carrot noses  
and formed snow angels  
flailing out our arms  
as if the snow were air  
and we were using  
our newmade wings to fly  
as we lay on our backs  
in the thick frosting  
with which the weather gods had overnight  
coated the earth for miles around  
a transformation that revealed the hidden magic  
that the world  
our childhood world  
was made of
