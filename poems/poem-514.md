How does one  
or rather how do you  
or I write about this time  
this sixth extinction  
how do we say goodby  
to fellow creatures who arrived here  
along with us  
after all these unimaginable  
spans of time  
and now are leaving us behind  
as they move on  
out of time's grasp  
leaving us to muddle through  
if we can manage it  
without them  
or are we perhaps to join them  
in this last hurrah?
