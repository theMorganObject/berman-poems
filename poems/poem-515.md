A summer's day on Martha's Vineyard  
warm and sunny  
my son is there and grandchildren  
I've smashed my car  
they've hauled it off  
I ask myself What was it worth anyway?  
Was I cheated?  
No - I think -  
it's time to let it go  
Hey Daniel, help me carry this boat  
down to the beach  
let's go for a sail
