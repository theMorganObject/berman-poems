Writing of purple violets  
in the flower markets of Kiffisia  
the year she lived abroad  
was young and on her own  
she remembered those Greek beauties  
as more colorful than any  
she'd seen in the decades since  
describes with obvious  
disdain our local offerings  
as quote pale and anemic  
thinking possibly  
not only of the flowers
