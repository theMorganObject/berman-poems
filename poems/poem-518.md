His name proclaims him god  
of gates and doorways  
time's own janitor  
who watches over passages  
transitions  
everything that swings  
in both directions  
life's dualities  
departures and arrivals  
births and deaths  
cycles of war and peace  
and although claimed by Rome  
his ancestry is ancient  
leading back as far as Sumer  
and no wonder  
for it clearly takes a god  
to see both ways at once
