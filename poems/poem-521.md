These bits of fluff  
these restless words  
so eager  
to be set free  
to float away  
like bubbles  
or dandelion seeds with  
tiny parachutes  
born on a gust of wind  
that comes and goes  
on its own schedule  
although I put my name to them  
it's an illusion  
thinking I can claim them  
when for reasons  
I can only surmise  
it's they have chosen me
