A restless species ours  
just think how far  
we've come since feet and hands  
were well adapted  
for moving through the trees  
and human babies  
even today are born with that reflex  
by which a monkey child  
clings to her mother's back  
grasping her fur  
how did we come to choose  
life on the ground  
out in the open  
where both dangers  
and opportunities were multiplied  
it seems that is our genius  
restless opportunists  
we've learned to thrive  
in every niche  
on every continent  
except Antarctica  
and now that we've forgotten  
what our ancestors once knew  
about proceeding as one part  
one thread in earth's  
rich tapestry of life  
we're ready to move on  
dreaming of other planets  
other homes  
like children quick to leave behind  
the sandcastles they've built  
once the tide has risen  
and the walls and towers  
start to crumble  
as the waves come rushing in
