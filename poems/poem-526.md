Whoo Whoo? says the owl  
and again Whoo Whoo?  
searching with great round eyes  
the night the darkness  
and for that if nothing else  
she is Minerva's bird  
Rome's mistress of all crafts  
goddes of wisdom  
since to be asking  
not just once  
but constantly  
who is it showing up  
now in this moment  
within the words  
the thoughts the gestures  
that I call my own  
what god or goddess  
what parent or ancestor  
and who am I engaging with  
what holy stranger  
stands here before me  
simply to ask this question  
then to pause  
and listen deeply  
that is in itself  
the heart of wisdom
