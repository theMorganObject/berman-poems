That's my little brother at fourteen  
beside a hemlock tree  
in suit and tie  
holding his french horn to his lips  
he's playing  
is it Mozart?  
for our mother  
who's so close she seems  
to need to lean away  
he's looking straight at her  
and she at him  
her hands clasped primly at her waist  
a pose or gesture  
that she's performed since childhood  
hair cut short  
her face seems boyish and impossibly  
young for her fifty years  
her smile says everything
