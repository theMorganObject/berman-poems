Is it just me  
or are there others  
whose headlights have gone dead  
while driving fast  
along a dark road at night  
and though the steering works  
the brakes are gone and cruise control  
won't let the car slow down  
meanwhile there's just enough twilight  
to make out along the right side of the road  
a wall of trees  
black forms like phantoms  
twisted and threatening  
maybe if I pull the keys  
the engine will shut off  
the car come to a stop  
but I've not thought of that  
and so it's only time  
until we crash into a ditch  
a tree or power pole  
or God forbid another car  
blinded like ours  
but still with any luck  
before I wake  
I'll think to pull the keys
