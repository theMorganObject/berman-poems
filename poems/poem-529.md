My grandfather Ralph Harlow  
whom I loved when I was little  
even more I think than my own father  
was proud  
perhaps inordinately  
of his New England ancestry  
and took me once  
when I was six or seven  
to see the Harlow house in Plymouth  
built they say in 1677  
by our supposed ancestor  
Sergeant William Harlow  
on that excursion  
the only thing of interest  
was a turtle I discovered  
in a pool nearby  
too deep for me to reach  
I can still see it clearly  
lying on the bottom  
its head pulled partway back  
into its seagreen shell  
waiting patiently
