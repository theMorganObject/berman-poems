Yeats had it right  
a poem should seem effortless  
words stitched together seamlessly  
so that the sound and meaning  
coalesce without a hint  
of being forced

A musician can achieve  
a high degree of fluency  
by practicing her scales  
arpeggios, glissandos  
playing exercises  
for the right hand  
or the left  
then using what her hands  
have learned  
to bring Bach's work to life

But a poet's work is rather  
like a potter's  
you do your best to fashion  
a rice bowl from a lump of clay  
it's a hands-on process  
to make it smooth and round  
skillfully shaped and close to flawless  
for the pleasure of your friends  
seated around the table

Like any other craftsman  
you keep your effort hidden  
masked by the illusion of  
an artist's inspiration  
it's the rabbit in the hat trick  
takes practice to pull it off  
the hardest part is bringing  
what you started  
to a graceful end
