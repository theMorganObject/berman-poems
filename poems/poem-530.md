Hard to believe  
one of these little animals  
who share with us  
a brain and nerves  
intestines  
and reproductive organs  
a creature tiny and invertebrate  
who fellow bdelloids have been around  
the fossils tells us  
twenty-five million years  
went dormant  
twenty-four thousand years ago  
in the Yakutian permafrost  
and re-emerged from frozen soil  
in 2015 quite alive  
ready to reproduce  
(no mate is needed)  
for it's brief life post cryptobiosis  
it must have been the oldest living animal  
we know of  
what other creatures may yet emerge  
as the tundra unfreezes  
is enough to give one pause
