Here is a man who's stretched out in a dory  
the sea is calm  
heâ€™s lying on his back  
he would be looking up at the pale sky  
except his eyes are closed  
though whether in sleep  
or death is hard to say  
either way he's quite at peace  
his face suggests a Dane or Swede  
and so perhaps  
an echo of the old ship burials  
though here there are no flames  
only a dory rising and falling  
rocking softly on the gentle swells  
a dream of death  
so peaceful so serene  
as to be comforting
