It’s not the only dory Wyeth painted  
something about the honest lines  
the planks worn smooth  
by weather and rough use  
has drawn the artist’s eye  
he could have gone for drama  
made the ocean dark and threatening  
focused on the scant few boards that lie  
between the doryman and the abyss  
but there's nothing of that here  
nothing that's sentimental  
yet like life itself the painting hints  
at something deeper  
something hidden just beneath the surface  
something elusive  
hiding in plain sight
