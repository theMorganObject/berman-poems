All that I remember is the image  
a dream the poet said he'd had  
a crowd of people  
trudging up a mountain  
while he ran pell-mell  
downhill with a guitar  
that dangled wildly  
from his neck  
and reading it  
I saw myself turn back  
and start the long descent  
into the life  
that would at last be mine
