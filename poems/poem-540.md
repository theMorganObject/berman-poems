From Plum Village in France  
news of your passing  
your moving on  
and leaving us to wonder  
how such peace  
as you embodied in your every word  
your every gesture  
the quiet sureness of your voice  
how the peace you taught  
with such compassion  
such insight into our too human hearts  
could have emerged from the inferno  
we call Viet Nham  
still meaning not the country  
or the people  
but the war  
that left such deep wounds  
in its wake

Your life a precious gift  
to all who knew you  
even at a distance  
through your many books  
the teachings caught on camera  
and how good to hear  
that after your long exile  
you were home  
in Hue in the monastery  
where you trained  
as a young man  
for your long journey  
to the West

Your presence now  
all the more palpable  
to those you've touched  
deeply over the years  
will live on as a reminder  
to bring forward  
something of your spirit  
of your peace  
into our lives  
into this troubled world
