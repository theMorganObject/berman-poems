This little ficus tree  
its trunk all twisted  
like a fat snake  
coiling upward  
headless  
no branches  
only leaves on tiny stems  
the whole at once grotesque  
and beautiful  
it speaks of that maternal love  
that hovers  
seeking to grasp  
and shape her child  
not let him grow  
from natural ground  
but with roots clipped  
held close for safety's sake  
within the sheltering confines  
of the home  
and yet growth happens  
life demands its due  
held back the bonsai  
still asserts its inner drive  
shows itself almost muscular  
and with care  
it will outlive us by some fifty  
or a hundred years
