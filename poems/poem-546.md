Fiolharpa which in Swedish means  
a fiddleharp  
but is no harp  
rather a folk fiddle  
with five bowed strings  
and twelve more known as sympathetic  
that vibrate subtly  
when their pitch is played  
surrounding every note  
with what would seem  
a sonic echo  
lingering for just a moment  
after the notes played with the bow have died  
the instrument that's here beside me  
arrived yesterday  
a year after I'd sent in my request  
to master craftsman Enar Magnusson  
now it's tuned up and sounds as sweet  
and magical as I had hoped  
born just a year before me  
Maestro Magnusson is coming up on eighty years  
how fortunate I am  
that he is still creating instruments  
whose sound can so delight the ear  
and fill the soul
