The biography is standing where I placed it  
on the bookshelf  
facing out into the room  
and from it Sebald stares  
with his right eye  
his left eye and the left side of his face  
are folded back inside the book  
his lower lip is visible beneath  
a close cropped mustache  
not the least hint of a smile  
only a tall forehead  
receding hairline  
and a look that seems to probe the viewer  
in a half-humorous half-serious way  
Speak, Silence is the title and the author  
writes how Sebald born in 1944  
was driven by the silence  
that descended on his world  
after the war  
which is to say on Germany  
after the Holocaust  
and after Allied bombs had left  
a pile of rubble  
where German cities had stood before  
but what he wrote  
the lives that he brings forward  
with such a depth of feeling and detail  
were as the book cover itself suggests  
half truth and half invention interwoven  
with great artistry and skill  
a monument to what was left unspoken  
by fathers who'd returned wishing to leave  
behind the horrors they'd experienced  
my own was no exeption  
so that reading Sebald there's a feeling  
I've encountered something strange  
and yet strangely familiar  
something personal I can't quite put  
my finger on
