Not the only  
but the sweetest and most innocent  
of victims caught up in our hero's mad pursuit  
of justice  
or was it all just to avenge  
his father's death  
his youthful heart  
possessed by that dire ghost  
no room for love  
not till the deed he planned  
was done  
and though Ophelia knew  
the language of the flowers  
pansies for thoughts she said  
thoughts pensive  
pansies pendulous  
both hanging heavy  
had she considered  
how the knowledge  
of a father's murder  
and a mother's cruel betrayal  
might unhinge a son's mind  
she might have waited  
guessing that he loved her still  
which he at last confessed to  
only afterwards  
learning that she had drowned herself  
the saddest death  
of all the many in the play  
the ones that follow  
offer no great surprises hardly shock  
the senses as her death by drowning does  
or is that only me
