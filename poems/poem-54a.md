(the backstory)

Kills Lensky his only friend  
in a duel over a woman  
a silly misunderstanding  
on the friend's part  
and Onegin somehow incapable  
of letting his friend know  
the actual circumstances

On Pushkin's part  
it's as if this death  
devolves from Lensky being so naive  
inhabiting an unreal world  
full of himself and of  
romantic hyperbole  
and being such a poor poet  
though forgiveable  
at just eighteen years old

And as with any novel  
the reader is privy  
to what's being kept secret  
from the dramatic actors  
and it's in truth the secrets  
the hidden truths  
that drive the plot forward

So that puts the reader  
in the position of a god  
who looks down and observes  
helpless to intervene  
and so absolved of guilt  
for any harm done  
no wonder we take pleasure  
in reading such fictions

And then the irony  
Pushkin himself dying  
still in his thirties  
in a duel over his honor  
involving the wife  
he'd married only recently
