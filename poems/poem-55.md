My father lying in the hospital  
on what was soon to be his deathbed  
turned to my wife with these words  
Carroll I don't know what we did wrong  
Stephen had every opportunity

Dear dad  
I knew I'd disappointed you  
with my meager accomplishments  
my patchwork life

I remember at fifteen I told you  
I thought for me it would be the guitar  
and you said  
if it were the piano or the violin  
you might understand  
but the guitar?  
and besides how would I  
make a living?

So I knew you took it hard  
when I left school  
and my first marriage  
and then two more  
though you were always  
gracious and welcoming  
of my new partners

Had I known you suffered  
felt the least hint of responsability  
for what you imagined  
my deficiencies my failures  
I'd have done more to share with you  
the many gifts of this  
amazing life I chose  
an artist's path  
guitarist, lutenist  
in love with my slender  
but demanding craft  
which your own example  
and achievements  
made possible in so many ways  
since it was from you I learned at last  
to follow my heart's passion  
even if that meant leaping off the train
