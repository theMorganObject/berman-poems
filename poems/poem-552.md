Dear Chairman Xi  
Please forgive the presumption  
but as a longtime student  
and lover (yes) of things Chinese  
I feel an urge to share  
an older man's concern  
for our grandchildren  
mine of course but yours as well  
and all the generations likely to follow  
long after we are gone  
of course the current military and political  
issues present themselves as paramount  
but what seems even more at stake  
the welfare of your billion and some fellow citizens  
and of the planet as a whole  
needs - I would think - to be the overriding  
focus of those in power like yourself  
and so the retreat of the Himaleyan glaciers  
whose waters feed the Yangtze and the Yellow River  
the Ganges Brahmaputra  
the Indus, Mekong and the Irrawaddy  
rivers on whom fully one quarter  
of the planet's people directly depend  
should be of greater interest  
to you and to your party  
indeed to governments and people everywhere  
than the question of Taiwan for instance  
or any of a number of strategic interests  
because it's clear with climate change  
either the era of competing empires  
will give way to one of global cooperation  
and world-wide mutual support  
or our grandchildren will never have the lives  
that you and I've been privileged to enjoy
