The house is strangely still  
even the dogs seem settled  
into a kind of quiet anticipation  
as if they've guessed  
they won't be left behind  
suitcases packed  
passports extracted from the safe  
the long itinerary copied out by hand  
how many hours from Sacramento  
to Needles, Flagstaff, Albuquerque  
Memphis, Louisville  
and then at last to Morgantown  
a week or more before we pull up  
at our daughter's door  
in West Virginia

May the highway gods look kindly  
on our travels  
may we do as little harm as possible  
may we bring smiles to the faces of the folks  
we chance to meet  
and when we reach our destination  
may we remember  
to offer thanks  
for all the blessings of the journey
