First morning at the house in Morgantown  
West Virginia outside our bedroom window  
snowflakes dancing in the wind  
even before my coffee  
dogs are out to pee  
and romp excitedly in all the whiteness  
puppies again they lick the snow  
like sugar candy  
three thousand miles we drove  
through seven states  
and now our new granddaughter  
is just down the street  
ten minutes walk away  
with loving parents  
tending to her every need  
and we  
feel such a wave of gratitude  
that she and they  
are safe and we as well  
safely arrived and ready now  
to settle in
