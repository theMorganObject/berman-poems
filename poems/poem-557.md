It's a week early but the neighbors  
have made an effigy of Old Man Winter  
and already their bonfire is sending showers  
of sparks high in the air  
swirling above the flames bright orange  
against the black night sky  
a dozen youngsters cluster in the yard  
to watch as Old Man Winter burns  
while in the house there's cooking  
they are here to join  
in the pre-Lenten feast  
this northern Mardi Gras  
that speaks more of its pagan roots  
than any Christian faith  
and though we've said goodbye  
to Old Man Winter  
by the look of things  
he's not about fold his tents  
and leave the field  
to spring anytime soon

meanwhile the day was full of snow flurries  
and it looks like spring is still far  
in the offing
