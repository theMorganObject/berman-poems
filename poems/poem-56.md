Neander means New Man  
yet they are twice as old  
as we who call ourselves the wise ones  
homo sapiens - latecomers on the scene

They left their bones in caves and shelters  
from Iraq to England, Russia to Lebanon  
and more than bones - stone awls, shell ornaments  
flower-strewn burials  
things we regard as touchstones  
of our own ancestral world

We carry a handful of their genes  
I like to think the mating  
was mutual attraction  
love not force

Forty millenia we've had the field  
just to ourselves  
and that's our loss

Whether we'll last as long as they did  
though time will tell  
all bets are off
