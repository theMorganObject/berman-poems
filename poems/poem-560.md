Avatars of what ancient plant spirit  
what goddess of the desert  
or the seaside dunes  
these babies with their blunt array  
of fleshy leaves  
their pointy tongues  
engorged and sensual  
as if straining to escape  
their three-inch pots  
their reds and greens a bit subdued  
yet vibrant even tropical against  
the dry brown largely leafless world  
outside the door
