Letters my sister sent me  
just last week  
from my father to his darling wife  
(and that would be our mother)  
sent from England  
during the Second War and Germany  
where he was sent  
once the fighting was over  
had I seen them while he was still alive  
I think that he and I would have been closer  
that I'd have reached out  
to that dear young man  
so full of life and so full of himself  
who wrote with youthful love and passion  
of his dreams  
his hopes both for the world  
and for the son  
whom he had yet to meet  
who by the way resisted  
accepting the new order  
once his dad came back  
but here's a letter from RÃ¼sselsheim in Hessen  
penned on my second birthday in July  
of nineteen forty-five  
he's learning how to play accordion  
still not knowing when he'd make it home  
it's been three years  
his eagerness is palpable  
as is his sorrow for the losses that he sees  
on every side  
not a household in this city  
he writes  
that hasn't lost a father or a son  
and often both  
no wonder that he worked  
in after years so hard to find a path  
to peace among the Great Powers  
to better understanding  
between Russia and the West  
and a rule of law  
holding the Nations to account  
I'm glad for him he's missing Putin's folly  
and this moment  
perhaps the most precarious  
since the ending of that distant war
