Am I wrong? Was Chernobyl an illusion?  
so that Russian troops can calmly go about  
shelling Europe's largest nuclear reactor?  
Has Putin lost his mind?  
"all going forward  
just as planned"  
is he possessed that he would risk so much  
and to what end?  
does he think Ukrainians will settle  
down and peacefully submit  
to Moscow's dictates?  
all these questions and no ready answers  
how much more suffering before we exorcise  
the ghost of empire  
learn to swallow national pride  
to mistrust the charismatic strongman  
and send off to history's dustheap  
the machinery of war
