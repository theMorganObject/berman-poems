Three weeks of driving  
hands clutching the wheel  
along the narrow thoroughfares of Pothole City  
that's Morgantown WV  
thank you Joe Manchin  
and all you fat-assed coal execs for dissing Biden's infrastructure bill  
I've learned to keep  
my eyes fixed on the road ahead  
while practicing  
the fine art of the swerve
