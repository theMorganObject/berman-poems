I've read that eyes are windows  
to the soul and if that's so  
our new grandchild  
not four months old  
works hard  
while she's awake  
to keep those windows open wide  
as if determined to be seen  
in every facet of her soul  
while likewise searching out our eyes  
as if to grasp what hides behind  
the masks we wear  
to know our nature  
our intent  
and something that she sees  
in us from time to time  
brings on the blossom  
of a full-blown smile
