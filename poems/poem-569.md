What can a poem hope to accomplish  
in a world  
where men and women differing  
only in circumstance  
from you and me  
have been displaced  
by ethnic violence  
war and drought  
and by the cries  
of hungry children  
one in a hundred of us  
somewhere in the world  
the number only grows  
while everywhere  
the nations build up walls  
as though the moat  
they make around their sand castles  
will save them  
from the rising human tide
