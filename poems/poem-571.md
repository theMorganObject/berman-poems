it's time to reel in  
stow the gear  
and head for home  
or as some anglers do  
stop by the fish market  
buy a nice looking trout  
to show the wife  
who's never fooled but still  
appreciates the gesture  
good for a laugh  
like this poem  
a cheap substitute  
for the real thing  
but everyone has days
