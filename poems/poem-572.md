(A Nursery Rhyme)

No jiggety-jog  
but the old cat was happy  
jumped on my shoulder  
nose to my ear  
curled in my jacket  
slept the whole afternoon  
while I bought groceries  
cleaned out the fridge  
stopped by the post office  
picked up our mail

The flight was no hardship  
only some part of me  
chose to stay back there  
in West Virginia  
with my wife, our two poodles  
our new baby granddaughter  
all the friends and neighbors  
we'd just gotten to know

I'm happy to be home again  
the house feels more than peaceful  
but even for someone  
as scattered as I  
this being in two places  
will take some getting used to  
thank god for the phone  
with its photos and facetime  
and my dear wife whose love  
reaches out across timezones  
transforming my world  
with her warmth and her laughter  
her wisdom and joy
