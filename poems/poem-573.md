(for Dennis Freese)

An afternoon in March  
 but felt like May  
We sat together in the shade  
 of the bamboos  
The fig trees budding  
 but not yet leafed out  
The hens all settled down  
 back in their run  
No breeze to break the silence  
 of the day  
No need to speak  
 but after a brief pause  
I said this is as much  
 of paradise  
As one can hope to find  
 such a sweet peace  
Pervades this place  
 and you replied not so  
I look around - you said -  
 and everywhere  
I see so much that needs  
 attending to  
And to myself I thought  
 so even here  
In paradise we're haunted  
 by the ghost  
Of our unfinished labors  
 if not here  
Where else will we find  
 respite for our souls  
And so we sat  
 a moment or two more  
Then headed back  
 and through the kitchen door
