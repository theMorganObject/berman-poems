Was it a dream or waking vision  
I don't remember  
only that the light from off her face  
was almost blinding  
“Stephen - it’s Caroline, your guardian angel!  
I’ve been assigned  
 the task of looking after you  
a penance for the ways I failed my son  
your grandfather,  
when he was just a boy.”

That was some years ago and now  
I’ve come across  
the girlish diary she kept  
back in the 1870s  
and on the inside cover  
she signed her name  
Carrie - the same nickname  
same spelling  
my wife Carroll grew up with  
and is still called by members of her family.  
I wonder - in some future life will I  
be pressed to look after a great grandchild  
I'd never in this life had the occasion  
to meet - as we say - in the flesh  
and will it be a penance  
for past cruelties or past neglect  
or a delight or just another step  
along the way
