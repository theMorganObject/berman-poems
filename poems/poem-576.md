Driving west along the Klamath highway  
on this first day of April  
through a corridor of pine and cedar  
stands of oak, madrone and willow  
that flank the river  
sometimes flowing calmly  
sometimes breaking free  
exploding in a squall of whitewater

Along the road my eyes are taken in  
with redbud now in the first blush  
of its new blossoms  
and with the maples shrouded  
in clouds of leaves just starting to unfold  
the soft green foliage practically translucent  
in the morning sunlight

Passing Ishi Pishi falls my mind turns back  
to the old Karuk tales  
how sly Coyote  
fooled the yellowjacket sisters  
stealing their fire  
leaving them forever angry but in recompense  
more striking in their brightly banded robes

Later on a beach beside the river  
my elderberry flute called up a song  
who knows from where  
perhaps some Karuk ancestor  
whose voice still hovers  
seeking to be heard
