There's that moment in the film  
when Eddie Murphy  
stands on a few precarious  
stepping stones that float  
over a black abyss  
he reaches out and drops a coin to listen  
for the sound the coin will make  
when it hits bottom  
somewhere far below

And the brief look of terror and astonishment  
when it dawns on him that no sound  
is forthcoming  
and that means - could it be?  
that the abyss he's standing on  
isn't just deep  
it's infinite

Given the actor and the plot  
it's a great laugh  
partly because it's also true  
because in life  
we each are balancing  
not always steadily  
over a space  
endless in depth  
and in the beauty  
of the worlds that it contains  
and thinking of the leap  
beyond this life  
that each of us must take  
it's good to know  
there's nothing there to fear  
that when we leap  
into that space  
while at the first  
it may appear like falling  
there is no bottom  
and no gravity to pull us down  
weightless at last  
we're safe in letting go
