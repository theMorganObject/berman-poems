When friends dissemble
hiding their hurt feelings  
it's like walking  
with a pebble in your shoe  
and you tell yourself  
it isn't worth the trouble  
to stop and shake it out  
so you put up with the discomfort  
till the pain becomes too much  
but once it's gone  
my god there's such relief  
and you wonder why it took you  
all that time and what you gained  
by trying to ignore that nagging grief
