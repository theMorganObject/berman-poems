Tonight I opened my laptop  
and on the screen  
the face of my friend Hank Levin  
who just last summer crashed his plane  
saving his wife the cost of a cremation  
ashes being all that was left of him  
and now he wants to friend me on Facebook  
or so the notice reads  
and though I know we're not done with eachother  
each of us doubtless holding something  
left unsaid  
I'm reluctant to accept the request  
if there's a Facebook in the sky  
where spirits post their latest pics  
I want no part of it  
the fact is Hank that you and I  
no longer need an intermediary  
if you want to talk I'm pretty sure  
that you know where to find me  
and you'll understand if I don't come  
looking for you  
we'll be back together soon enough  
perhaps even before you know it
