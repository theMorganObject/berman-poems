Long since abandoned  
 the village mill  
 stands with it's wheel  
 as if on pause  
Back in the day  
 what did the local  
 farmers bring in  
 to be ground?  
Hard to imagine  
 wheat or corn  
 grown on slopes  
 as steep as these  
Wish that Antonio  
 my wife's bis-nonno  
 were still around  
 for us to ask  
In nineteen-seven  
 he'd come back  
 to Pontori  
 to sell the mill  
And then returned  
 to San Franisco  
 bringing along  
 a second wife  
As for the grinding  
 my guess is chestnuts  
 the flour used  
 for poor folk's bread  
Just as the native  
 Californians  
 ground ripe acorns  
 to make their flour  
Here in the green  
 Ligurian hills  
 the chestnut trees  
 grow everywhere  
I'd love to come  
 for the fall harvest  
 it's past now but  
 perhaps next year
