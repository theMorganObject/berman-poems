The boy would sit there  
heedless of the passing hours  
his fingers on the dropline  
feeling the current's hum  
waiting for the tug that meant the bite  
of summer flounder  
porgy or tautog  
basking in the scent of creosote  
the motion of the tides that swirled around  
and through the cabled pilings  
strewn with barnacles  
orange sponges and seaweeds of every hue  
their thick black shafts seeming to undulate  
while disappearing into greater depths  
around them small fish schooled  
and larger ones  
at times rose into view

The line he held sang softly  
and insistently  
of hidden worlds  
currents and depths of life  
that otherwise eluded him  
feeling himself alone  
with nothing certain  
his mind could hold onto  
but with his hooks well baited  
he would sit and think  
of what great creatures might be swimming  
further out  
beyond the harbor in the deeper ocean  
that soothed his heart  
even as the humming dropline  
taught his hands to listen
