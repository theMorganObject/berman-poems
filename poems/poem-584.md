Back in the corner by the fence - Agnes  
first of our roses to come into bloom  
her peachflesh petals glowing in the sun  
and look - the bumblebees are buzzing madly  
to and fro, chasing off competitors  
working themselves deep into the matrix  
of the newly opened flowers

Here's a bumblebee whose body  
is entirely black  
a burly native of our region  
I wish him all the pleasures  
of the day and bless his work  
since though we're a month early  
and that's worrisome  
this sight of bees and blossoms  
is truly a delight

Cautiously I bring my nose  
up to a flower  
and inhale the same unearthly fragrance  
that I remember from last summer  
it's a scent  
unlike any other that I know  
no other rose  
for all that I enjoy their different odors  
moves me as this one does  
at my age  
it's almost like making love
