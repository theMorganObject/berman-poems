When Raven sought to join the human world  
he'd slip into the womb of some chief's daughter  
so that as a child he'd be well cared for  
cherished by his maternal grandfather  
whose magical possessions Raven planned to steal

Today to my surprise I sense I'm following  
in the tracks of that sly trickster  
swapping places seeing through the eyes  
of our granddaughter who at twenty weeks  
looks out with such delighted concentration  
on the freshness of a world as magical  
as Raven once created when he stole  
the sun and moon the daylight and the stars
