After yesterday's snow the lilac growing  
beside the fence  
can hardly bear the weight  
of her own flowers  
the slender branches bent  
low to the ground  
the leaves with their bleached underside  
now facing upwards  
give the whole bush  
a most bedraggled look  
the forecast week of rain  
will scarcely bring her back  
but once the sun returns  
perhaps in May  
she surely will regain  
her former elegance  
if only the pale lavender  
of her spiked blooms  
will last another month
