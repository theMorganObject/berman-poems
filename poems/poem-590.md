Poems of lonliness and distance  
of heartfelt grief  
reflected back in the last light  
of springtime passing into autumn as if summer  
had never happened  
her own beauty  
like the plum blossoms she loves  
appears all too ephemeral  
she notes the swallows  
heading back at dusk to hidden nests  
but for the poet  
her beloved stationed in some farflung  
outpost of the empire  
there's no love nest  
only her cold rooms and empty bed  
no wonder rice wine seems  
her close companion  
and yet she clearly takes to heart  
the rigors of her craft  
fitting her words and rhymes  
to match the rythm  
of the songtunes she has chosen  
and so achieves a formal beauty  
poems of longing fashioned with  
patience and skill - a vessel  
to contain her sorrow's overflow
