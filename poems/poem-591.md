My brother on WhatsApp  
sits at the little upright  
in his Sao Paolo studio  
reminds me that it's Pesach  
with a jazzed up Go Down Moses  
sounding for all the world  
like a Missisippi blues  
his voice is hoarse and raspy  
like Bobby Zimmerman's  
who made it to the Nobel Prize  
though I wonder how far he'd have gone  
if he hadn't changed his name?
