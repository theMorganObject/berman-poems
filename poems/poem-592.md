Poem after poem paying tribute  
to a dear friend  
a younger brother or a fellow  
seeker of such truths as might be found  
in the secluded temples  
buddhist daoist  
he loved to visit  
riding at times on horseback  
from his ancestral home  
and of other truths he found  
reflected in the wildness  
the beauty of the mountains  
the many rivers  
whose names like gems  
are scattered through his poems  
all the places where he sought  
and often found  
refuge from the dust of cities  
the civic duties  
which also were his life  
and everywhere his words  
are there to celebrate the human bonds  
he held in such profound regard  
that every parting  
was marked with grief and poetry  
and every festival  
observed with sorrow  
for his absent friends  
and loved ones  
it's no wonder he himself found such regard  
such deep affection  
from his contemporaries  
fellow poets such as Li Taibo  
who declared him universally admired  
for his refinement  
his eaygoing charm  
and now after another thousand years  
and more I too praise Master Meng  
whose four-line poem  
of blossoms lost - but how many?  
in last night's storm  
are still found on the lips  
of every Chinese schoolchild  
and remembered by their parents  
the names of emperors  
and statesmen are forgotten but a poet  
such as he stands tall  
a beacon in our darkness
