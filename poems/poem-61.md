hawk haiku sequence

    						looking up

A pair of redtails
circling high above the trees
taking me with them

    						finding a dead hawk

What was she thinking
leaving her body lying
here in this meadow?

    						sharpshinned calling

Territorial
or just letting his mate know
he's thinking of her?

    						a lightningfast hunter

a flash of silver
the air showered with feathers
perigrine falcon
