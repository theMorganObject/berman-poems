In my mind's eye  
I see them dancing  
in rhythmic motion  
circling the fire

No music other  
than their own voices  
their chanting carries  
in the night air

Faces of these  
our older cousins  
illumined by  
the leaping flames

Their shadows flicker  
on the cave walls  
the fire keeps  
the bears at bay
