Through the narrow passageway  
that leads into the crawl space  
it's too dark to see a thing  
without some sort of light

Rodent droppings everywhere  
spider filaments hang down  
floor joists still appear intact  
but there beneath the bathroom tub  
serious water damage  
something I can fix myself  
or should I call for help?

Think I'll head back  
to the daylight  
other folks can poke around  
if they wish to  
in this underworld  
there's enough ghosts  
in my dream life  
no need searching for surprises  
and besides from what I've seen  
this old house still has  
at least a few years left in her  
and that's enough  
that's all I need to know
