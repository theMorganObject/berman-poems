If there's a heaven Julian is there  
with his sweet lute  
"I'll now play Tarleton's Riserrectione  
with Lady Clifton's Spirit in pursuit"  
then Dowland's Melancholy Galliard  
puts this, his newest audience  
into a revery  
while Come Sweet Love transports  
angelic hearts with its  
celestial harmony  
tell me, without Bream's music  
how could it be heaven?
