July of 1970

Was he even human?  
once when he was greeting an old friend  
I stole a look into his eyes  
and felt myself  
falling through endless space  
it scared me shitless

But how comforting his presence was  
during the weeks of sitting, chanting  
learning the initial steps and language  
of the practice

The room we sat in  
with its Chinese screens  
of faded red and gold  
had once been dedicated to Tin Hou  
Empress of Heaven  
watchful guardian of sailors  
of the immigrants who risked  
passage from China to Gold Mountain  
that is, San Francisco

A room now taken over  
by Buddhas and Bodhisattvas  
where the Abbot  
Master Hua would stand  
as pigeons flew in  
through the windows  
landing on his shoulders  
eating from his hands  
to our amazement and delight

He would feed them  
from a jar of corn seed  
ruffling their tailfeathers  
to their great consternation  
laughting all the while  
to let us know he knew  
we were no different in our greed  
for what it was we'd come for  
what it was he had to offer

He was the first and only  
human being I had ever met  
who seemed to me  
entirely beyond fear

His fearlessness inspired me  
with the courage that it took  
to leave the path  
I'd followed all my life  
to jump ship so to speak  
and choose the artist's lot  
not knowing how I'd ever manage

The nuns seemed to have found in him  
a wise and loving father  
a spiritual guide  
to whom they could  
entrust their lives

His teachings and his stories  
were what kept me there  
those weeks  
though I was never  
drawn to a monastic life

After a time I'd been away  
he asked me why  
I didn't come around  
and I said something flip about  
keeping the Wayplace  
here inside of me

He laughed and said  
what's this inside and outside  
no such thing exists  
if I'd been ready that might well  
have been my moment  
but instead it's been the riddle  
I'm still working on  
I suppose some of us  
are simply slow to learn

Once I heard him say  
in death he'd be  
returning to the stars  
over the years I've also come  
to think that passage in that way

After his nirvana  
I joined the hundreds  
maybe thousands  
that came from far  
and wide to pay respects

Chanting the name of Amitaba  
we walked around his coffin  
fitted with a little window  
and a light to see inside  
every now and then someone  
would step out from the line  
look in and bow in reverence

So I though now he's dead  
and finally it's safe to gaze  
into his face  
but when I did  
I felt I'd been again  
struck by a bolt of lightning

It makes me smile to think  
of that brief moment  
my last earthly interaction  
with the man who more  
than any other made  
my life here possible
