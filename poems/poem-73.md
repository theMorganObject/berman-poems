             Last Blossom on the Rose

Only four days left of these  
precious October days  
with their clear sunlit mornings  
chilly nights now down to freezing  
and in defiance of the cold  
the Japanese rugosa  
I planted just a year ago  
has put forth one last bloom  
pale yellow petals intricate  
with a faint scent of cinnamon  
a parting gesture marking  
the end of all that summer gave  
and winter's close approach  
a lovely gesture of farewell  
a dear friend's goodbye wave
