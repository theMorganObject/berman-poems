Dear P.

After all the harm you inflicted  
maliciously (the sheriff's word) shooting out  
our greenhouse windows,  
damaging doors, walls, cabinets, carpets,  
breaking flowerpots, windchimes,  
leaving bullet holes in trees,  
in outside walls, even in the roof,  
you might think I was happy to see  
your face in the police roster  
for assaulting a Home Depot employee.

But that's not the case  
I feel only another level of sadness  
contemplating the world you've been  
busy creating around yourself  
with all the paranoid surveillance  
the constant shooting  
and the sign Trespassers will be shot!  
and on and on  
it only makes me sad  
thinking how a smart and clever  
young man like yourself  
can have gone so far astray

I blame myself  
for not knowing how  
to reach out you and Katherine  
I blame our country  
and its leaders who have set  
so poor an example  
have done so much to mislead  
so many citizens  
I blame the global capitalist orthodoxy  
on track to create fascist regimes  
here and abroad  
(fascism - what you have  
when the boundaries  
between corporate capital and government  
become blurred or disappear)

When you told us th
When you told us th
When you told us that your goal  
was to be a millionaire  
by your mid-thirties  
I might have begun trying to engage you  
not to argue  
but to explore ideas with you  
learn where your understanding comes from  
maybe help you discover for yourself  
its limitations  
I can hardly blame you  
after all isn't wealth the prize  
America holds out to one and all  
happiness through wealth  
and through the power it bestows  
and we both know that poverty  
at least here in America  
is a miserable existence

I'm guessing you never had the modelling  
of loving parents who embodied  
in their own lives  
the values that could lead you  
to an emotionally rich  
and spiritually fulfilling life  
a life of service to others  
or to something deeper  
more rewarding than mere wealth

What I mostly see in you  
is your anger  
its source is something  
I can only guess at  
I believe all members of your generation  
have every right to feel enraged  
by the greed, stupidity, the wastefulness  
that we your elders  
have stubbornly continued to indulge  
and that has brought our fragile (it turns out) planet  
to the very edge  
to the sixth extinction which  
aware or unaware  
we're living through.  
beyond our ability to fully fathom  
and which has the potential  
to take all of us  
along with it into oblivion

Now that is something worth  
your and my anger  
though I won't live to see it  
my grandchildren likely will  
and you as well  
are set to see at least  
the first levels of change  
things we've already had a foretaste of  
the recent fires, flooding, stronger hurricanes  
but all of these are only a small sample  
of what's coming when (by mid-century)  
we pass the tipping point  
and head on toward the 4 to 6 degrees  
of warming (Centigrade) the science says  
we're on track for  
and unlikely to avoid

What's the big deal with 4 degrees?  
For one thing some half a billion  
climate refugees  
(perhaps including us thanks to the fires  
already sweeping throught the west)  
and that means if not wars  
the kind of governmental overreach  
ICE as just one step toward  
the totalitarian state  
that's the nightmare of both  
the right and of the left

If that's the future  
I can understand your anger  
but it also strikes me that with your  
energy and smarts  
it's a sorry shame you're not applying  
what you have  
to the real issues of our time

I know you like to think  
in terms of conspiracies  
the real conspiracy,  
what's keeping us  
I mean America and  
the other global powers  
from a response  
appropriate to the crisis  
is the ideology of unfettered capitalism  
the global market taking precedence  
over the efforts of local economies  
as long as that doctrine and faith hold sway  
the local and collective actions  
needed to slow down  
the coming catastrophe  
will be always defeated

So time to consider  
making a life change  
if not all at once  
then over time  
moving toward more honest  
and more civil  
if not loving  
interactions with the world  
with fellow citizens  
of all persuasions  
practicing what the buddhists call  
right livlihood  
though it may not lead to worldly riches  
it will bring greater happiness  
contentment no amount of money  
can bestow  
you can still become the father  
you would have wished  
for yourself  
a loving family must be  
the greatest happiness of all
