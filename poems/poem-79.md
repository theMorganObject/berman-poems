The file  
kept by the FBI  
my dad was able  
to obtain  
thanks to the recently  
passed FOIA signed  
into law in '66 by Johnson

Much of the wording  
was blacked out  
but at the end  
the briefest note  
"Who is this kook  
anyway?"

And then  
the author of the note  
a scribbled signature  
just three letters  
J.E.H.  
and thank you Mr. Hoover
