How did they keep them fresh  
on the long road  
from Samarkand  
the golden peaches  
destined for the Central Kingdom  
for the court and table of the emperor  
Xuan Dzang?

I can hear the camel drivers shouting  
urging the caravan along  
with all due haste  
swarthy men  
heads wrapped in colored turbans  
faces covered  
to keep out sand  
eager to arrive  
with their fine cargo  
still intact  
the fruit still crisp  
fit for an emperor

The Silk Road  
if only by its name  
provokes a fantasy  
of things exotic  
enticing merchandise  
fabrics fruits furs  
loaded on camels  
striding single file  
across the sandy wastes

I imagine them stopping to drink  
to rest and spend the night  
at an oasis  
a time for entertainment  
dancers moving  
to the sound  
of shrill reed flutes  
and high-pitched voices  
singing of love and sorrow

All this passes  
as they say  
before my eyes  
while I delight  
in the aroma  
and the deep  
red and gold palette of this fragrant tea  
from Fujian Province  
that I bought  
from Silk Road Teas  
whose printed logo  
is a camel loaded down  
with what must be  
the finest Chinese teas  
worth surely every penny  
of the price

But truly this tea's flavor  
and aroma  
subtle, exqusite are a world apart  
from Liptons  
and leave me in awe  
thinking of the patient loving care  
through millenia of cultivation  
in the hands of Chinese farmers  
working on the hillsides  
in the fields  
who doubtless never saw  
the rewards their labors merited  
never saw or  
much less savored  
the golden peaches brought from Samarkand  
by caravans making their way along  
the route so evocatively named  
the Silk Road
