A young sperm whale
just half the sixty feet  
of an adult  
washed up

at Patrick's Point

Lying at low tide  
on the rocks  
a ways offshore  
from Agate Beach  
her body dark  
and a bit sad  
to look at  
hardly menacing

My friend Bill  
practiced in the art  
of making fish prints  
brought a roll  
of paper  
maybe five feet wide  
with a supply of ink  
and made a print  
of the whale's flukes  
a dozen feet across

A sperm whale's flukes  
in life a gracful form  
of power and beauty  
captured on paper  
in a gesture  
honoring this  
wild creature's death

Meanwhile someone before us  
had absconded with the ivory teeth  
for scrimshaw I suppose  
a precious plunder  
but to me an act  
of wanton desecration

Within a week the whale  
had washed away  
returned to ocean depths  
now food for crabs  
for fish and gulls  
feeding the life  
from which she came

Grey whales are common  
up and down the coast  
a sperm whale though  
conjurs up thoughts  
of whaling ships  
of Moby Dick and Ahab's  
hapless crew

And this one left me  
even in her death  
somehow shaken  
changed  
as when in dreams  
a creature from the wild  
gazes with eyes  
that seem to understand  
your loss  
your banishment  
from their more deeply felt  
more soulful world
