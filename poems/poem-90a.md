We've made killing too easy
a song for our times

Every week it seems I read  
some child has shot himself  
or someone else  
a sibling or a friend  
last time that I looked  
it was a three year old in Texas  
killed himself with a pistol  
some fool had left around

We blame the careless adult  
who left the gun in reach  
but perhaps the problem is  
it's all too easy  
people talk of gun rights  
and what they mean is killing rights  
the right to shoot some stranger  
with your gun  
some stranger who seems threatening  
who might otherwise shoot you  
because he found it easy to  
go out and buy a gun  
it's so easy now  
to get a carry permit  
join a patriotic rebel group  
it's easy now  
to get yourself a gun

some think that a civil war  
is in the offing  
we the people  
should be armed and ready  
for a fight  
it sounds heroic and romantic  
but anyone who's seen war close up  
will be quick to tell you  
that ain't right

And how many children have to die  
before we change the laws and make it  
harder to have guns around the home?  
We call ourselves a Christian nation  
can you imagine Jesus packing  
heat
