This little tree  
confined to a ten gallon pot  
set up against the south side  
of the house  
will want protection  
from the winter frost

Despite the cold  
her leaves have kept  
their color  
and their gloss  
the lemons still  
a pale lime green  
are mostly hidden  
in the foliage  
but promise  
in coming months  
an offering  
abundant  
ready to delight  
our palates and  
adorn our kitchen windowsill  
with color  
primed to offset  
the grey skies  
of December

So a cold frame  
such as this  
is what she needs  
to ensure  
her fruitfulness  
won't come to naught  
after such generosity  
it's the least  
we can do  
to protect her gift  
the precioius fruit  
she bears
