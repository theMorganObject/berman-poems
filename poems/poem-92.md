That's us but personally  
I would decline the title  
on behalf of all my  
buddhist friends  
and vegan sisters  
our cat however  
having found himself a seat  
atop the fence between us  
and the neighbors  
and under the recently  
denuded maple  
surveys the yard below  
tail swishing  
focused as any lion  
gazing out across the Serengeti  
for sign of easy prey  
an ailing antelope  
an elephant cub  
that's strayed behind the herd  
so Ollie looks for fluttering  
of little wings  
a bird too chilled  
by last night's frost  
to launch herself  
skyward in time

We too were there  
out on the Serengeti  
hardly top predators  
we learned to run  
behind the lions  
eager to be first  
among the scavangers  
grasping our crude stone axes  
to get at the rich marrow  
hidden inside the bones  
the lions left behind  
all the while watching  
anxiously for whatever  
might come after us  
so even now our cat  
displays a calm assurance  
that I myself  
distant descendent  
of those scavengers  
can only envy
