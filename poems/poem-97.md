a poem after Liu Tsung-yuan

Yesterday after a long dry season  
the pond began to fill  
I grabbed a rake  
pulled weeds and leaves  
out of the feeder stream  
that runs along our fence  
I've never known  
exactly where the water comes from  
only that it flows  
from somewhere  
in the hills above

All summer long  
the pond looked barren  
a dry hole  
now the water's surface  
once again reflects  
the trees that line the bank  
blackthorn and elder  
oregon ash  
a rose gone native  
a blur of green bamboos

Just overnight  
the landscape has regained  
what it had lost  
to summer's drought  
a living mirror  
its murky depths  
prepared to hide  
the little lives  
of tadpoles  
turtles, fish  
to feed the herons  
the loudmouthed kingfishers  
and to nourish these  
our thirsty souls  
that need the water's gift  
that we too  
may take delight  
as we join in the dance
