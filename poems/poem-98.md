The bones you buried  
underneath the house  
it may be best to leave them  
where they lie  
the attic  
that's another story  
worth delving into  
sometimes treasures hide  
in those dark corners where  
you've stored forgotten  
remnants of your former self  
the tokens of  
your former lives

Mostly though it's boxes  
waiting for some future move  
but there's also the dollhouse  
your grown daughters loved  
when they were kids  
and grandma's china  
deemed too delicate  
for table fare  
the winter jackets put away  
in some forgotten spring  
and never brought back out

Then there's the subtler stuff  
regrets, remorse  
the childhood fears  
long set aside  
but never loaded  
on the trailer  
carted to the dump

When finally you crawl  
into that narrow space  
you see that everywhere  
rats have been busy  
gnawing holes and making  
an ungodly mess  
It's time to clean it out  
to it leave it empty  
as when you first moved in  
it's never pleasant work  
but once it's done  
you find that somehow  
it's gotten a shade easier  
to move on
