Too tired to think  
much less to write a poem  
worth any reader's time  
I set my fingers  
free to play on the computer keys  
curious to see  
what they might do  
mostly nothing it seems  
rather like waiting  
for the planchette  
to move across the Ouija board  
hello? is anybody there?  
best be prepared  
for who or what might surface  
from thin air  
or from the source  
we term unconscious  
thereby revealing  
a certain prejudice  
but so far  
no voice from the underworld  
no muse impatient  
for my musing fingers  
to press down  
on the keys  
and form the words  
she'd choose for me  
only this tired babbling  
time now to let it go  
and go to sleep
